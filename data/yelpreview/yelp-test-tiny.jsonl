We played craps as first timers and they walked us through it and we really awesome about being patient with us. The downside is that the hotel is away from the strip and you need to take a tram to get to and from. The tram takes a while to get back an forth so you end up waiting around. Also it is a little older but it is very clean."}

This actually has turned into a spot for hubby and I to go to when we want to cruise the downtown scene.  \\n\\nI highly recommend you get here before everyone gets off work, because like any other downtown metor area, parking will be limited.  \\n\\nAmbiance is what you should expect, dark\/dim lighting, loud music, and crowded.  Not too big of a deal because you will be so busy concentrating on demolishing your food any way.  \\n\\nWe have only been here 2 times and we have yet to try so many options here.  There are so many different pizza combos to try, that you better bet we are coming back to eventually try it all.   \\n\\nThe combinations of flavors that they put on their pizza is awesome.  Don't be afraid to add more protein...it might add that added Yum to your pizza.  Whats important to me when I eat a pizza, its the crispiness of the crust.  Thats exactly what you get, a nice crispy pizza. \\n\\nThis place is a must try!"}
{"label":1,"text":"Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o\\n\\nI had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!\\n\\n I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50\/50 flour\/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.\\n\\nThe inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.  \\n  \\nMy grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.\\n\\nThe buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.  \\n\\nI'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :\/"}

{"label":0,"text":"Worst upscale restaurant in vegas.  I went with my wife and another couple.  We love great food and have tried many of the great restaurants in vegas.  This is definitely not one of them.  Our friends ordered steaks which were mediocre at best.  I had the halibut which was dry and had no flavor.  I switched it for the salmon which was dry and also had no flavor.  It didn't end there.  We got the mac and cheese which tasted like kraft easy mac mixed with chopped pieces of deli ham.  The mashed potatoes were chalky and bland.  Im really not sure how you screw up mashed potatoes that badly.  I could have done better blindfolded.  Finally, my wife had the lobster, which was just ok, not great.  Overall, the ambience is amazing, but the food just flat out sucks.  To make matters worse, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy.  Las Vegas has too many outstanding restaurants to waste time and money with this place, especially for the price! I will never go back to this place, or to another one of Ducasse's restaurants for that matter."}

{"label":3,"text":"Trust me, splurge on a Go room.   But be prepared for plenty of pink.  And a very, very long line at check-in.\\n\\nFor the money, on the location, the petite Go Room is all you need as a home base in Vegas.  Mine was immaculately clean upon arrival, with crisp sheets and a comfortable coverlet on the king-sized bed.  \\n\\nThe Go Rooms aren't for everyone, though.  I was puzzled at first about the frosted glass surrounding the bathroom, and the ambient pink glow that diffused through the glass.  I ended up using the bathroom as a tacky Flamingo-pink nightlight.  (Since I usually end up leaving a light on in a strange place to keep from having a 3AM \\\"Where the hell am I?\\\" moment, this worked for me.)  The bathroom door was on a slider, which kept the room from feeling cramped.  \\n\\nA lot of the room's space is taken up by the bath, and there's a lot of little touches to make this space feel upgraded.  The shower has some additional jets, but, they can't be angled, so at my short height, they were more awkward than luxurious.  I would have liked a tub, but, my room didn't include one.  There was tons of hot water and great water pressure, so no real complaint about the shower other than the lost opportunity to have it be just a little more fabulous.  The hidden television in the mirror was an amusement, and kind of neat when getting ready in the morning.  Toiletries supplied were a touch better than average, but I'd recommend hitting the Walgreens up the street for an upgrade.  \\n\\nThe luxury room faced the strip.  The 17th floor had a spectacular view of Caesar's palace and the Bellagio fountains.  But, a strange screen material made the view hazy -- it took me a while to realize that the screen was the building-sized advertisement for the Donnie and Marie show.  One of the best parts of staying at the Flamingo is that unlike Caesar's, you don't have to stare at that eyesore of an advertisement!  \\n\\nSoundproofing was reasonably good, though I could occasionally hear a loudmouth next door.   The bed was comfortable.  And despite my repeated attempts to tip my maid, money was never, ever removed from the room. I felt that my belongings were secure, though, if you've got really valuable items, there's an in-room safe for them.  \\n\\nDeeply disappointing, though is the $13.99 wired internet charge despite a premium price for the room.  Wireless is also available for a similar charge. Internet access is charged per device, so, choose wisely.  Phone service, like most phone service in Vegas, is insanely overpriced - bring your cell phone.\\n\\nThe Flamingo has a small garden with its namesake birds and a few other unusual specimens, a relaxing refuge from all the casino action.  The Vegas ghost tour stops through there at night to tell some spooky tales.  But, late at night, I was approached in the garden by far spookier panhandlers looking for a cigarette handout.  I doubt that'd happen at Caesar's, and it make me question the overall security of the property.  Each night, fliers were slipped under the door - timeshare promos, pizza parlors.  Nothing terrible, but, it appears that the Flamingo doesn't necessarily monitor things quite as vigorously as some of its sister properties.  \\n\\nI spoke with a few other guests when relaxing in the garden, watching the wedding parties take their photos.  From what I heard, some other guests encountered uneven service - a diabetic unable to obtain a refrigerator for a regular (non-Go) room, others complaining of sub-par linens on the beds.  So, not all rooms at the Flamingo are created equal, and special requests might go ignored.\\n\\nBut, I'd stay in a Go room again in a heartbeat.  The close proximity to the Strip and the relatively petite size of the property compared to a lot of the other megacasinos nearby makes this a great launching pad for your Vegas adventures.  Stock up the minifridge as your own personal minibar with a trip to the Alberson's up the street, and you've got your own personal haven from the noise and the bustle below when you need an escape."}
{"label":3,"text":"So I went here for lunch the other day with a couple of friends. The food was really good, some of the best thai food I've had in phoenix. I got the drunken noodles and they had a bunch of delicious fresh vegetables and I ordered it medium spicy, and it really was a true medium spicy, not too weak and not too strong. The soup that comes with lunch is really weird... kind of sweet and kind of spicy.... not the best soup ever, so that knocked off a star, but other than that, I thought the food was very good. The prices were a little bit higher than at other Thai food places in the area, but I am willing to pay a bit more for better quality. I will definitely be back."}
{"label":0,"text":"Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste."}

Three full bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and everything was so sleek modern, I loved the wide open space windows that not only gave us the view of Marquee Day Club, but the Bellagio water show and Paris' Eiffel Tower, making it a one spectacular view.  We had a flat on the 27th floor which was a rented flat to guests. I will note that I was a little taken back that a blow dryer was no where to be found, simply because, well, any rented flat or a hotel I've stayed at provided that particular vanity amenity.

As I had mentioned above regarding the eerie tuning nose, apparently, the Veer Towers is known for this misfortune and just wasn't constructed correctly. The tuning is caused by the high winds that blow through the towers next to the other hotels, but The Veer seemed to get hit the most with the strenuous tune.\\n\\nBut I kid you not regarding that loud tuning noise, I was seriously terrified that evening and I felt like we had UFO's around us, that's how intense it was.\\n\\nHowever, besides the noisy ruckus, I loved it, and would love to stay here again, just hopefully under a much windless weekend x"}

{"label":2,"text":"A good friend of mine brought me here yesterday after raving about the amazing street tacos and salsa. I'm always down for good Mexican food so we hopped in the Mom-mobile and were on our way! \\n\\nI ordered the Friday special which was 2 hand tacos with choice of rice or beans. You could choose chicken or beef and I asked for one of each and asked for a side of beans as well as I wanted to get the full flavor. My friend had the street tacos pastor, asado, and carnitas style.We also shared chips and salsa with guacamole.\\n\\nI ended up getting 2 beef tacos and no beans. I didn't want to make a stink about it because I didn't pick the restaurant but when I asked at the counter about the beans, they said they would bring them out and never did. Luckily my baby had beans with his cheese quesadilla so I did get to try them but meh..they were just ok. The spanish rice was under-seasoned and all I could taste was salty chicken broth. The guacamole was pretty tasty though the avocado was overpowered by the salsa that was mixed in to it. The salsa was very tasty. And I was kind of surprised that the chips and the hard shells on the tacos weren't house made or if they were...they've got it down to such a science that they seem store bought. \\n\\nMy friend enjoyed his street tacos but he agreed about the rice being under-seasoned and over-brothed. \\n\\nThe staff at the counter were nice, but they were firmly planted there. No one came by the tables to check on people and even though we chose to sit outside, they didn't move from their spot to let us know our food was ready. \\n\\nI'll go back to try again if we are in the area because my friend really likes it there and I want to try to get what he's seeing but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back without him."}

I called ahead  & scheduled a 5pm appt, on a Thursday. I showed up 20min early (my errands didn't take as long as I was expecting) so didn't mind waiting. \\n\\nIt was now 5:03p & I was still waiting (5 appt, not a big deal). But then, a regular came in after me (they greeted each other by name). She sat by me for a few minutes, then was taken to start her mani before me! Finally at 5:15p, the lady (seemed like the owner) took me to a seat to start the process to remove my gel polish. I'm not big on talking while getting my nails done, but she didn't say 1 word to me. And she made feel like I was an inconvenience to her (even if I was, I'm paying you money to run your business). So after putting the tinfoil on, she said I'll wait 5minutes, that's standard. \\n\\nFinally, around 5:32 (15 min later) another girl, Jessica greeted me, apologized for the wait, & began. She gave me a small water bottle, cleaned her tools in barbacide, thanked me for waiting & did my mani. Jessica was sweet & the highlight of my trip.  Although, I am not satisfied with my French tip mani I received... We met at the register & I handed her her the coupon. Because I received French tip I assumed they would honor the \\\"gel mani coupon\\\" but add an additional fee. Jessica spoke to the lady I assumed is an owner (the 1 who started to remove my gel). Jessica then told me they cannot accept the coupon & had to pay full price. Did I mention no where on that coupon does it list any restrictions?\\n\\nThe time was now 6:40p, 2 hours after I arrived, 1 h 40m after my appt time, I just wanted to go home so didn't argue. So, NO, I will never go back. It's a cute, small, clean place. But not only did I have a horrible 1st impression, it wasn't a good job. The polish didn't cover my full nail (looks as if some of my nails already 'grew out'), the white isn't even (looks like some areas are missing a coat), & there's a white cloudiness in some areas of my nails that are supposed to be the 'natural' color. \\n\\nI'm glad majority of people love this place.

Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4\/1\/2014.

{"label":2,"text":"Came to Bonanno's upon arriving in Las Vegas after a long flight delay, hungry for a late night snack. I had a slice of gourmet veggie pizza (gotta get my 5 a day somehow!). It cost $6.49 plus tax, which I guess is cheap for the strip but was otherwise the most expensive slice of pizza I have ever had. It was okay. Shortly after eating my pizza, I moved on to Bally's and found a place that sells $2 tacos and margaritas - a much better deal, in my opinion. \\n\\nWhile I can't speak for the other menu items, I can't help but feel there are just better options elsewhere on the Las Vegas strip, even in the middle of the night. That said, if you really want a slice of pizza and you're on the go, this is the place. The pizza (fold-worthy, NY style) comes in big slices and has decent crust, fresh-tasting simple sauce (not over-seasoned) and a fair amount of toppings."}

{"label":0,"text":"The M Resort doesn't nearly deserve any of the praise and hype in my opinion.  Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and cr\\u00e8me brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  \\nHowever, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  \\nI thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.   \\nI will never step foot in the M resort ever again and neither will my friends or family.   So guess how many stars I'm giving the M?"}

If you want to take it a step further, get some yucca fries and bathe them in one of their signature sauces and then wash it down with some Maracuya (passion fruit) juice.

I cringe every time I think of Panda Express.\\n\\nThis is a review about Yum Yum, don't get me wrong, but let me tell you why you should come here instead of Panda. Practically everything at Panda is dipped in some cornstarch concoction and fried. That leaves for a large volume of your meat being starch. This place is awesome, because they don't do that crap. The mongolian beef is all beef and plenty of vegetables. The mandarin chicken is less fatty than Panda, at Panda the chicken is fairly fatty. Anyways, I like this place a lot for the reasons I've already listed. The taste doesn't overwhelm you like it does at Panda. Yeah, Panda is good the first three times you try it, after that its rather bland and maybe even gross. \\n\\nService here was excellent. Came in, got a smile, got my food, they were willing to do half chow mein, half rice. Awesome. Pricing is good, thus, value is good. Its a little too Pandy Express ish, everything looks like Panda, it tastes better though. If they could get a little creative and invdividual, they'd be 5 stars."}
{"label":2,"text":"UGH. How many Chicos, Victorias Secrets, and Zumiez could one suburban town possibly need?! I had such high hopes for DT Summerlin, and thought it would be laid out more like The Grove or Century City in LA, with pretty outdoor walkways, places to sit in the SHADE, and new and interesting shops or stalls. NOPE. The center driveway is for cars much like the District in GV now is, and there are no covered awnings or benches (which are made out of metal btw- LOL), so summer shopping should be a blast when it's 110 degrees. It actually had more of a vibe of an outlet mall, very sparse and dry. The two department stores, Dillard's and Macy's are on the far end of the largest parking lot, and Macy's looks like an old dilapidated department store, not one that just opened. \\n\\nThe walkways in between the stores are interesting, it's almost like the mall is cut in half and you have to go down an alley to get to the other side of the shops to see what you might have missed. The only restaurant open when I was there was Crave, which had a 2 hour wait, but other than that I think the only two additions will be CPK and Wolfgang Puck. The Nordstrom Rack, ULTA, Trader Joes etc. is on the OPPOSITE side, which is both good and bad. If someone just wants to go grocery shopping and run into NR, they can pull into that lot and not make a mess of navigating the mall, but if you are out shopping for the day, you'd have to move your car. \\n\\nI'll only return for Nordstrom Rack..."}

Just the way I love my Asian noodles to taste like! Noodles weren't dry and it was pretty flavorful. \\n- Salmon Nigiri: Can I just say.. YUM?! The salmon was nice and buttery. It tasted so good and fresh! But can I just say that the rice tasted TOO vinegary for my liking.\\n- Kalbi ribs: Ehhh...

Though I wish the crab legs were a bit more meaty though. The ones at the Carnival buffet at Rio had more meat and were a bit more flavorful than the ones here.\\n- Beer-battered shrimp: Not my favorite.. And I LOVE BEER. I was expecting these to taste like heaven but the shrimps were too overcooked so the meat stuck to the shell. I don't know about you, but I want to eat ALL of my shrimp meat.\\n- Cocktail shrimp: I prefer the ones at the Carnival buffet better.

It was like every single item I got was a little part of heaven going into my mouth.

I think that's a pretty good deal.\\n\\nI got strawberry cheesecake ice cream with chocolate chip walnut cookies. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, the cookies were too hard. It was tough getting the sandwich out of the styrofoam container, so I just ate it out of the cup with a spoon instead. No biggie.\\n\\nMy son got the rainbow sherbert with chocolate chip cookies. He loved the ice cream and his cookies were perfect -- chewy and moist. Perfect for taking a bite out of without the ice cream shooting out the back. Just like his dad, he doesn't like to share his food, but I managed to try a little bit.\\n\\nWith ice cream sandwiches it's hard for anyone to top Coolhaus in LA, NY, etc, in my mind. They've got a ton of unique flavors. I'd love to see Sweet Addiction add some crazy flavors like that (whether they make it themselves or source it from someone else).

{"label":3,"text":"Komex opened up a secondary new location! It was not as busy as the original, though it's brand new and I wonder if people just don't know it's here. It's not far to head here though if the other one has a fairly long wait. \\n\\nWe met up with our friends and shared a few items and got some individual tacos: \\n\\nTacos - they now offer pork belly which was rather tasty and tender so I definitely recommend getting it on something with it. Also got daegi gogi\/pork which is my other favorite taco. \\n\\nPork Belly Fries - Lots of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and pork belly. Messy, but good and a large share- able portion.\\n\\nFusion Wings - This comes with plain fries and the wings were nicely crispy with a sticky sweet and spicy glaze. Really enjoyable as I have a little bit of a affinity for sweet and spicy wings.\\n\\nFusion Flautas - This is one of my favorite things to get. The flautas are crispy and yet fluffy fried tortilla stuffed with a good portion of meat and cheese. I enjoy the mix of guacamole with sweet Korean sauce they do. I love that there is more than enough for the flautas and extra always to dip chips in! \\n\\nService was friendly enough. We had a second round of tacos and unfortunately it took long to get it. She did apologize and explain that a large party was before our order put in so not really their fault. \\n\\nThe food taste the same, which is a good thing and I saw one of the owners here running the front so I'm glad they seem to be doing right with consistency of a second location. Will be back, it's not far from my work."}

I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I have not waited less than 20 minutes. Even today the line was only 5 people long and it took 20 minutes because they kept running out of stuff. \\n\\nI absolutely love chipotle and the food here is no exception in that regard. my bowl was delicious as always but there are dozens of chipotles in the area here so why bother with this awful location? \\n\\nThey probably don't even read these reviews because they don't care about their guests.\\n\\nThe cash girl was busy flirting with an employee not working. The black guy on grill was busy watching everyone coming through the door instead of preparing for the rush.

{"label":4,"text":"I have a love hate relationship with roller coasters.  I go through a set of emotions every single time I ride them. Stage one: complete and utter excitement run through my veins when I'm in line, making it impossible for me to stay still or be quiet.  Stage two: silence, regret, fear, and locked knees as I near the very front of the line, to the point where I legitimately want to get out of the line and chicken out. Stage three: pale, white face as the ride starts, kicking myself for getting onto the ride and not chickening out earlier. Stage four: the best time of my life as I free fall, ride through loops, spirals, drops.  Stage five: wanting to go again after stepping off the ride!\\n\\nNow as you can imagine, going through this routine every time is very emotionally draining but the NYNY Roller Coaster totally makes it worth it!  I've been to Six Flags about five times, so I've been exposed to some pretty awesome roller coast rides.  But this roller coaster in Vegas is still able to wow me!  It has everything I enjoy, the crazy fall in the beginning, loops that fly you upside down, spirals, mini drops, speed, and to top it all off, you get an amazing view of the strip.  It's a must to do this at night because the lights become a beautiful blur that really adds to the experience.\\n\\nThey have a few different ticket options.  You can pay for a one time ride for $14. And if you want to do a re-ride, there is a sign that says it's $7 as you leave the ride.  Or you can get an all day, unlimited pass for $25.\\n\\nIt's a little difficult to find the roller coaster if you don't know where you're going.  You have to go  through all these twists and turns in the NYNY arcade.  Don't  worry about any bags or personal belongings.  They have lockers that require two quarters, and if you don't have change, there are change machines nearby in the arcade.\\n\\nDon't leave Vegas without doing this!  :)"}

Apparently they thought I said smoke full because that's what I got. \\nEven if they fix all that crap you still have to deal with the fact that you are at the end of the strip and have to walk a mile to get to he center of the strip.

Due to HRH assigning my room to someone else, we weren't able to check in for multiple hours, forcing us to re-arrange as well as miss some parts of our plans.  After multiple fiascos with re-keying the wrong room, giving our room to another group NOT in our party, and locking us out of room where we were already checked-in, the final straw came when manager came to fix issue, offered a $50 credit WHICH WAS LEFT OFF WHEN I CHECKED OUT - I had to call back and remind the manager of the situation - she promptly credited me the amount. Prior to her entrance into the process, had a hostile check-in agent (verifiable by 2 others in my party) who wouldn't help us and arguably told us that there was nothing we could do to get into OUR room, even tho it was their hotel check-in system that was preventing this.  As for the room, wiring was confusing - in order to keep bathroom light on, needed to turn on a switch in the bedroom.  BEWARE, one of our party had a \\\"room check\\\" where hotel staff came into the room UNANNOUNCED. As we were in the room, we asked what this was - they said it was standard policy.  We're a group of 40 yr old dads in corporate management - why check our rooms without permission?  completely unacceptable and shady.

We head all the way back down to let them know of the situation and they give us the exact same room three floors up, but we don't get any upgrade for our troubles. Lame. My only other beef with this hotel was the stupid night stand light that would not turn off. It was extremely difficult to fall asleep with a light that stayed on right above your bed. Other than that, my stay was pretty pleasant.\\n\\nThe suites are amazing! They are huge in size and can comfortably fit seven people without a hitch. Keeping the guests in mind, the Palazzo provides a pullout bed, which is actually comfortable for the suites. The beds are very comfortable, and these kinds of suites were made for large groups. As always, the bathrooms are also large and nicely decorated. There is even a small television in the bathroom, which was new to me! I thought the remote control to operate the curtains and blinds were a nice touch.

Easy and quick access to the tables downstairs - specifically craps. Thanks for the good times and paying me and my friends off on that heater table.

You'll find people of all ages and dress codes with no pretense whatsoever. \\n\\nThe food: They have a pretty varied menu and I was in one of those moods where I didn't feel like reading so I skipped right to the omelets. These are build-your-own and all you need to do is select three ingredients and voil\\u00e0 - you're done. I went for caramelized onions, wild mushrooms and breakfast sausage because I was feeling a little meaty. My omelet arrived, piping hot, with a side of potatoes and fruit. I enjoyed the omelet very much; it was nice and fat and had the perfect mixture of ingredients - not too much or too little of one ingredient over another.  The potatoes left me feeling indifferent, however. They were crispy on the outside, which I like, but the inside was very dry so I suspect they were over-cooked. Additionally, they were sorely lacking in flavor. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and loved them. Apparently their specialty is chicken and waffles so I'd like to try that out. I really had to fight back the urge to pull a Bill Murray and grab a waffle out of my neighbor's plate - them waffles looked REAL good!\\n\\nService: Pretty good. We were greeted upon entering and they prepared a table for us very quickly. There did seem to be a lot of employees floating around the place - I constantly felt like I was surrounded by waiters.\\n\\nOverall, I liked this place and would return. The only downside was where we were sitting - right by the door. Every time someone came in, we felt the cold draft, and people sort of piled up right behind me. The up side is that we were right by the window, so there was a lot of natural light."}

The hotel really booked me in a suite that already had customers still in it. I specifically booked that suite to enjoy a pre honeymoon weekend with my husband. They ended up changing our room to another suite (not the same one as booked) which was ok but I still wanted to be booked in the room with the jacuzzi. The hotel is beautiful and the food was good so I think they just need a better check in system because it took them FOREVER to figure out the situation once we told them the room they gave us was already occupied.

Be prepared to kill your precious time in the office. The nurses are nice and friendly, but cannot say the same for the office staff! \\n\\nAlthough we saw Dr. Fleisher regularly throughout the pregnancy, we didn't get him for the delivery. Instead, and UNFORTUNATELY, we had Dr. REBECCA TYRE who was on call for the delivery. In all fairness, we knew from the onset that getting Dr. Fleisher was not guaranteed and that we could get any of the six doctors for the delivery. And we had hoped that it would be OK to have someone other than Dr. Fleisher for the delivery as we had developed a good relationship with him. \\n\\nNow, the perplexing thing is not that we had a HORRIFYING and TRAUMATIZING experience with DR. TYRE, but that it is almost an established fact that DR. TYRE universally and repeatedly gets bad reviews! And please go check as many webmd reviews as you wish! She is unacceptably unprofessional. Now my question is to the office, Green Valley OB GYN: Why do you still have TYRE on board despite the fact that she has an established track record of traumatizing your patients??? It is such a shame when her own colleagues from the same office badmouth her practice and professionalism big time, yet still keep her there and allow her to ruin people's most important and emotional moments... \\n\\nNow please read our personal experience with Tyre below if you think that I am a little too harsh and decide for yourself...\\n\\nWhen Tyre came in to the delivery room at St. Rose Dominican Hospital, she didn't even bother to greet us! First thing we heard from her was \\\"where are you from?\\\" We knew that it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, but she was on call that night! In only 15 minutes, she was able to traumatize us big time and to completely ruin the most magical and memorable moment of our life. Our daughter was born with a minor birth defect and Tyre broke it to us in an extremely unprofessional way. She looked at our baby and said \\\"what is wrong with this baby? Take \\\"it\\\" and check \\\"it\\\"!\\\" She didn't even let us enjoy our baby for one moment, shed happy tears, or celebrate the arrival of our precious angel. Then, of course, we completely freaked out, trying to figure out what was going on, but she refused to elaborate anything, stating that it wasn't her job to diagnose the newborn! \\n\\nA heartless and unprofessional woman, a monumental shame to her profession! She should not be involved with childbirth, one of the most emotional and magical human experiences ever. She is an arrogant doctor, and a horrible, ugly human being...Stay away from her, and from this office if possible..."}
{"label":0,"text":"Ok. On the advice of a few friends who have been living in Scottsdale for a little while, I decided to take the gf here for her Bday as Mexican is her fav. We're both from Manhattan and are used to getting damn good street tacos and decent Mexican food. So we come here dressed casual chic and apparently the hordes of locals, many of whom I suspect make 30K a year but acted like they make 1 million plus, were dressed in suits and such. Keep in mind, I am in investment banking and my gf is in fashion so when saw this, were were giggling inside. However, this apparently warranted sub-par service as the waitstaff was apparently ignorant and knows not what they do. No surprise here as Scottsdale and most of the area can be accurately described as trailer trash trying really hard to pretend they live in a real city and actually have real jobs. So what we do is what we always do when we try a \\\"hot restaurant\\\" for the first time, we order the one dish that a place like this should never screw up. We ordered tacos. The meat tasted like it was pulled from some frozen TV dinner box, smothered with way too much sauce and overly salted. We decided to end the night right then and there. It was an absolute disgrace. We have had much better tacos at holes in the walls on random streets in NYC. I still don't understand how this place gets such raves and high reviews. Maybe they've never tasted real, authentic Latin\/Mexican food before and this is the only thing they have to benchmark against. Such a sad state of affairs, like so many things in AZ."}

They had a great website and the owner, Jason, had a very dynamic personality said he was an 'Enrolled Agent with the IRS, etc. Seemed good. \\n\\nMy first clue should have been they were more concerned about getting their first check, than they were about the information needed to create the bookkeeping and tax files. Months would go by without hearing from them and when you'd send an email, there would be no response. When you called, they would say there was an 'email problem' and to send it to a different email address. Then there was always an excuse for not replying; \\\"I'm traveling.\\\", \\\"I'm not in the office\\\", \\\"I'll have ____ check on it\\\", etc.\\n\\nTax times rolls around and the owner brags, \\\"All businesses wait until October to file their taxes, I've already put yours on an extension.\\\"  Great! Then I got calls from my folks that said they hadn't received their 1099's. The office couldn't find the information, so I resent. I gave them numerous documents to work on bookkeeping, and nothing ever got put in place.\\n\\nFinally, I called the IRS and asked if an extension had been filed? The answer? No, but we see someone TRIED to file an extension on June 17th.  Of course, when I called Total Business Solutions, Jason was 'traveling', but would get back to me the following week. I went into the office and asked for my tax documents. They handed me the same envelope I had given them and not one single letter or document with tax information had been opened.\\n\\nThe bottom line? I paid this company more than $3000 in less than 12 months and never received one item of work in return. IRS 1099's not filed, personal and business taxes not filed, no bookkeeping, no receivables\/expenditures, nada. But they did deduct their monthly fee.\\n\\nI have subsequently found out there are several others with this experience.  Be very careful about hiring this business.

{"label":3,"text":"Well hello sailor.\\n\\nWhen I had a 1940s event to attend (maybe a Yelp Elite Event that I was hosting...)  I realised I had nothing to wear to the ball! I had visited Lady Jojo's a few times, and never been able to justify buying a beautiful frock, with no occasion that called for a stunning piece of tailoring.\\n\\nAnd so when the question arose of where I could get the perfect dress for my final hurrah and my last Elite Event as the CM, I knew where to go. The dresses aren't ever  at bargain prices, and for good reason. I'd wager the average price is around \\u00a370. I spied a beautiful one on the sale rack, luckily in my size... et voila. It fit like a glove. Or a glass slipper. Or the most beautiful dress I've ever worn.\\n\\nAs I was there, I tried on 5 different dresses out of curiosity. Holy mama. Why don't we dress like this any more? I know women used to have to wear dresses only, and it was a big revelation when we could wear trousers without being considered weird. And I do like trousers, they are practical. But every single one of these dresses fit like a dream, and flattered me in all the right places. More so than any 'vintage inspired' dress from high street shop.\\n\\nThe tailoring is of the highest standard. You know that whoever designed, sewed and fitted this dress was doing it with the sole purpose of making which ever femme fatale wear that dress, that they would look fabulous and nothing less.\\n\\nIt does sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet. But given the amount of compliments I got on the dress and my outfit on the night, I can assure you that it was certainly the beautifully made and fitting dress that stole the show. No high street brand dress would ever make me look or feel that fabulous.\\n\\nThe dress could be worn again, admittedly not just for a laid back Friday date night dinner. But it's low key enough that it will do for birthday parties, new years eve parties... if only I could get away with wearing it to the cinema, brunch, my grocery shopping...\\n\\nI love the dress, I love the shop, I wish I had more reasons and moolah to shop here. A very special \\\"treat\\\" shop, for that once a year special occasion. But if you are feeling like you're having a bad hair day, go to Lady Jojo's and try on one or five of these dresses. You will look fabulous, and will brighten your day no end."}
{"label":3,"text":"I wanted to try this when I was here last year, but I had to wait a year.  Like many similar spots throughout the different casinos this is a frozen drink and bottled beer stand that serves blended slush like drinks in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.  This one is located just outside of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino's Street of Dreams next to the Starbucks at the foot of the escalators leading visitors to the Aria\/Crystals\/Bellagio free tram.  The location is in a bad spot hidden from view from visitors exiting the Street of Dreams shops.  There is bar seating and small round tables nearby as the Monte Carlo website depicts (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=HWH4uputadH926t3vAqz6A).\\n\\nMy friends walked over to Starbucks for some after-dinner coffee, but since I don't drink coffee I decided to have an alcoholic slushie instead.  Of the eight or so blended concoctions I went with the 16 ounce Blue Ice (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=w-MIlrBEGwq3Sh1GUL7g9g) made with SKYY Citron Vodka partly because I'm attracted to blue colored drinks like blue Gatorade, blue PowerAde, Blue Raspberry Slurpees from 7-11 or blue cream soda.  The vodka taste stood out quite well and with the exception of a few spells of brain freeze I enjoyed the drink very much.\\n\\nThe flavor was neither too sweet nor too tart.  It was a very good smurfy blue after-dinner refresher.  The $8 price for a 16 ounce serving was exactly the same as all the other similar frozen alcohol blender stands we saw at other casinos along the Strip.  Jello shots are also available but not every night."}

She, not only charged us for our meal, but also for my roommates meal. A $30 meal turned into $70, and from that, a whole lot of problems.\\n\\nWhen we went back, the sign said they would open at 3. When we went back at 3, the sign said 4. When we returned again, pissed off, the sign said 5.

The lobster was definitely frozen and the imitation crab stuffing was awful. The raw oysters didn't have any flavor and the leg of lamb was dry. I do have to admit the prime rib was good as was the lobster bisque. However it still wasn't worth the $49.99 price. I've had better, for instance, Wynn and Bellagio.

I've been spoiled by Bon Chon and UFC on the east coast....so it doesn't quite compare, but it will meet my chicken cravings until I can escape to another city.  They have two flavors of their fried chicken...the spicy sauce version and the regular fried chicken.  Obviously the spicy sauce makes the skin a little less crisp...so I would say go with the original.

{"label":2,"text":"Usually I would have something better to say about this place but my last experience was not the best. I have to say I have been in a few Wild Wing locations but this location is BY FAR the tackiest of them all. It looks like a novelty store threw up or something. There are multi colour, beach themed murals on the walls, a Giant light up palm tree, saloon style old western doors and all kinds of junk hanging from the ceiling including sports jerseys, athletic bags and other various sports related items. It really is over the top cluttered and hectic and this is coming from a person who thinks the decor at Jack Astors is great. So that's gotta tell you something. Anways, on my last visit I order medium wings, which is rare for me because I tend to prefer somthing hotter but I was sharing with a friend who doesn't like spicy food. When our wings arrived we both bit into them we just looked at eachother with panic beucase our mouths were burning. I chugged half a beer because they were that hot, which for me would be fine but my friend looked like she was going to fall off her chair. When the waitress came back we explained how hot they were and my friend told her she would not be able to eat them the waitress said \\\"Well yeah, the medium wings here are pretty hot\\\" and looked at us with confusion as if we were supposed to just know this or something. We asked if there was anything she could do and she offered to bring us out some ranch dip or mild sauce which to me is a joke. I used to work in a Sports Bar and I know for a fact I would have immediately offered new wings or at least a credit to the bill. Instead she offered nothing, so my friend ate nothing and we paid and left. I will go back because I have had better experiences there in the past but all in all the customer service was not good. I must say however, I did like the wings and I usually order hot and quite honestly I think the medium ones are hotter so I will likely order the medium in the future."}

{"label":2,"text":"Let me start by saying that the service is excellent! Brian, our waiter, was really attentive, had great recommendations, and enhanced our overall dining experience. The food and ambiance, however, were okay...nothing special. The steaks are gigantic so if you're going for portion size, this is the place to be. However, I felt like both our steaks were a little too charred and both had really large chunks of pepper scaterred throughout. We started with the crab cakes followed by the dry aged rib eye and the Kansas city strip, and then the root beer float and cookies for dessert. One of us got the pri-fix menu with the dry aged rib eye. I'd definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu since you get an appetizer, a trio of sides, and a dessert. This is a special menu you have to ask for though...so they don't offer this deal upfront. The truffle mac and cheese and brussel sprouts were my favorite dishes of the evening. However, I was disappointed by the steaks and the ambiance was underwhelming for Vegas."}

One of the newer seafood spots in town, Boiling Crab lets you order seafood by the pound with your choice of sauce.  I went for the Whole Sha Bang sauce, which is a mix of each individual sauce (garlic, cajun, etc.).  The sauce was certainly garlicky, but it lacked that delicious punch that makes you crave more heat.  When it comes to restaurants like this, it's all about the sauce, and sauce was just alright for me.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant itself, it is spacious and littered with (small) TV's.  Lots of seating available, both tables and booths.  Walking in, it was nice to not be overwhelmed by the smell of their special sauces, probably due to the large space.  During my visit there were several large groups that came by, and there was no issue with seating 20 or so people together.  One interesting thing that we noticed was the amount of wait staff working.  We got there around 4:00pm, and there were about 25 people working.

{"label":2,"text":"As a served buffet sushi restaurant, Kanda would be a rare bird on the west coast, but is surprisingly a common style over here. For your $15-25 (depending on when you go) the result is very much dependent on the ebb and flow of the restaurant.\\n\\nWhy? Because you literally order from a list. Each table has a sheet that you fill out with a pencil - maybe you want 1 roll here, 1 gyoza there - in an all-you-can-eat format. Some food is going to be cooked specifically for you, while others might come as part of a larger batch. (There's a price penalty for uneaten food.)\\n\\nIn theory, this is great. You could order one from everything on the menu if you have the stomach for it! In practice, this means there is batch cooking, which means you might get something piping fresh one minute and something from the waiting line the next. (The busy nature of the place seems to ensure your food is mostly fresh, though.) For better or worse, the chaos spills over to the waiting too; while food delivery is almost always prompt, drinks\/orders\/bills may take some chasing to make happen.\\n\\nI think the Kanda experience is best described as a search for \\\"surprise\\\". The menu is build to have you hunting outside your comfort zone, trying out various items you may have not tried before. As a group experience, that's great. As a seasoned sushi-connoisseur experience, you may want to look elsewhere."}

It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. \\n\\nAlthough the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. \\n\\nWhatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate!

We planned to go elsewhere that night for dinner, so we decided to try just one appetizer. We selected the Chicken Phyllo Packets. They were just ok. The ingredients were all high-quality, and the portion was large for an affordably priced appetizer (~$8), but the flavor of the feta was overwhelming and we could barely taste the red pepper and chicken. For the price we paid for two drinks and an appetizer (~$17), we got to sit  and enjoy a lively after-work scene and we definitely had a good time.

WAY TOO MUCH. And no other condiment really... Their subs consist of 90% lettuce\/sprouts, 8% mayo and 2% misc(meaning mystery meat, tomatoes, maybe cheese, etc)\\nI just don't get why anyone would want to eat here? Unless they're drunk!

I will never order that again.\\n\\nMy friend upgraded his cappucino to the larger size (cup? bowl? I can't remember the name, sorry!). Essentially, this meant that for just a dollar more he received an entire soup bowl filled with cappucino. Crazy."}

{"label":3,"text":"Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!\\n\\nWhat you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!\\n\\nThe food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!\\n\\nCoffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well. \\n\\nWe used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board. So sad! We really missed it on this trip!"}
{"label":1,"text":"This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average.

{"label":3,"text":"I do love my cameras.  Taking a good photograph is something that I get a great deal of joy from.  Jessops is a great shop for all things camera, and it was their store on Shandwick Place that I visited today.  I mainly went in to have a look at their tripod range, as this is something that I've been thinking of purchasing.\\n\\nEntering the shop was an oddly relaxing experience.  Unlike some stores, the walls and shelves were not crammed floor to ceiling.  Instead, the displays were laid out in an uncluttered manner that doesn't bombard your brain with a lot of information.  \\n\\nThe store is quite large, and covers all aspects of photography.  You can get all sorts of cameras from small point-and-shoot right up to high-end digital SLRs.  They also stock binoculars and telescopes, along with accessories for all of these things.  I had a good look at their range of tripods, which covered a large price and size range.\\n\\nJessops is a must for either browsing or buying photographic equipment.  They also do printing and processing, and clearly know their stuff, having been around as a company for 75 years now."}

{"label":4,"text":"Review #200!  Woo Hoo!  Let's bring out some stars!\\n\\nThis Discount Tire went out of their way to help me get some new shoes for my 'Eva', the 1986 Honda Prelude Si that sits in my garage.  Ode to a classic!  \\n\\nAnyway, I was picky even wanting to get tires for my girl.  The Pirellis she had on her were classic too, so classic that they were made in 1998!  Yep, the tires I bought with the car were close to 15 years old!  I hated to even consider changing them out because they had little wear, 80 % tread life, and no signs of cracking.  But even the best tires should be considered for change after 10 years time for safety's sake.  Who wants to risk a blowout while cruisin'?  Not me!\\n\\nI considered Sam's Club and Costco first for a new set of tires.  Sam's was out of the running quickly because they didn't even offer the right size for my rims.  Finding a 13 inch tire is hard now-a-days!  Off it was to Costco.  After a quick search, Costco came out of the gates with ONE set of tires from Michelin.  The famed Michelin Defender, their newest high-end tire.  I figured it would cost me a pretty penny since they were top of the line.  And I was right.  A darn 13 inch tire would cost me $91.50 EACH after mounting, install, tax, and fees.  About $366 for a set of four!  Wow that's expensive!  Especially for a car that I will be driving no more than 5000 miles a year (darn right Eva has a 'classic vehicle' plate).\\n\\nI told Costco I would think about it.  I've heard horror stories about their tire department service from others, and the amount of waiting time needed just to put tires on a car.  After the price quote, I was told by Costco that if I dropped my car off at the first signs of opening it would take about 2-3 hours for it to get done.  If there was someone who managed to get in front of me before my appointment, it would take 3-4 hours.  Really?  Now I'm no mechanic but I do know it shouldn't take that long to put a tire on a car, especially when you have specific equipment to handle this.\\n\\nAs a giggles experiment I called Discount Tire.  I was greeted with a warm tone, and began to speak what I needed.  Though I would be up Shi+s Creek when it came down to price because Costco is the supposed 'price leader'.  What happened surprised me.  Not only did I see they had the Michelin Defender tire that Costco had, they also had 2 other companies that made tires for my car rim.  These were also cheaper than the Michelin ones!  But, dude on the phone informed me that they're cheaper because they were rated for less miles than the Michelin ones.  The Michelin Defender tires are rated at 90k miles, which means I wouldn't have to change the tires for a LONG time with my light driving on Eva.  He also mentioned the Michelin tires have a better review rating as well.\\n\\nOther tires were out, Michelin was IN.  But, now it came down to brass tacks.  Got the quote from Discount Tire and it was much higher than Costco, like $50 higher for the set of four.  Told the guy on the phone that I would probably hit Costco instead because of the price difference.  He asked me how much they were charging me.  A pause, and a few keyboard strokes later, and dude from Discount Tire price-matched it!  Then he came down to $360 with tax just to make the number more rounded!  Told Discount Tire guy when can we schedule and I was in that next Saturday early.  \\n\\nUpon arriving, I was greeted then asked to assist with mileage on the car.  Discount Tire was like, \\\"Nice ride!  So clean!  This really an 86'?  I'll make sure on the order to tell the guys to be careful with the car.\\\"  Then he marked the order in red all over 'classic'.  Before paying, of course I was gonna be upsold.  I was prepared to say NO.  Was offered their lifetime warranty for $20 on EACH tire.  I was like, \\\"Nah, I won't do it unless the total for me is less than $400 out the door.\\\"  Discount Tire dude was like, \\\"Hmm.  Let me see.\\\"  A few button clicks later he tells me he can do $399.xx out the door.  I was on the fence.  He tells me that the lifetime warranty covers EVERYTHING on each tire, defects, warping, cracking, nails, even if it is my fault.  For the life of the tire.  Dammit, I signed up!  Comes out to less than $10 per tire for warranty.\\n\\nTidied up the bill, and sat and watched every move those tire techs did on my baby!  They really were careful, took off the rims and center caps gingerly, and went slow with removing my old tires.  Even then, the entire job was done in only 30 minutes!  No more waiting!  Great, friendly, fast, efficient, and reasonable service!  Tires were shined, and Eva was pulled out slowly to the parking lot.  All new shoes on her!  So pretty!  \\n\\nI will be back to Discount Tire for my tire needs for now.  Price-matching and service for me can't be beat.  My Eva and I thank you!  Love that new tire smell."}
{"label":0,"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this salon, based on the positive Yelp reviews.  The stylist I had seemed very apprehensive and inexperienced. It almost felt as if it was the first time he was cutting hair professionally (shakey and slow). \\n\\nHere's the kicker, I go to pay and asked what the original cost was (because I always tip on the original amount of the service) and the receptionist tells me its $35. The groupon I purchased was $30 (supposed to be a $70 value). I was shocked. I saved a total of $5 by purchasing the groupon. \\n\\nBottom line, they clearly reserve their higher level stylists for non-groupon clients. The whole point of the groupon is to try out a new salon and hopefully become a regular client. I suggest the folks at Folicle remember that moving forward."}

{"label":1,"text":"Review for Sunday Brunch:\\n\\nFood 4.5\\nService 1 and that is being kind.\\n\\nI love the concept of half buffet and half ordering off the menu.   You really can't go wrong with assorted pastries, sushi, shrimp, smoothie bar and a panini  and crepe station just to name a few options.   Off the menu the standouts for me were the Lobster Brioche, apple cinnamon pancakes, pork ribs and the junk food dessert platter.  Honestly, I thought the food was all amazing.\\n\\nNow, the service on the other hand was a major fail!  I'm paying for bottomless drinks and I shouldn't have to wave or hunt down staff for this.  Even ordering our first items off the menu upon arrival took quite a while.  Keep in mind we joined a large ongoing birthday party in the back dining area.  At one point someone in our party took it upon themselves to retrieve the champagne and serve us.  \\n\\nJust like my prior visit for dinner, Simon did come out which is a nice touch.  I do love the atmosphere and our group did wear PJs which is fun so I will probably be back but for the price I expect better service and next time won't be afraid to ask for management if I'm not getting it."}

The fish tacos were delicious, and seasoned perfectly. They had a corn salsa, spring greens, and a chipotle ranch on them, all going really well together. The only reason I gave four stars is because of my side, the cilantro lime rice, it was too acidic for my taste, but I added it to my tacos, and it added some good flavor to them."}

{"label":4,"text":"I've never reviewed anyone on Yelp but my experience at Nail Envy made me do it because it was THAT good.  I just moved to NV in the Henderson area and needed to find my regular nail salon here.  After searching a bunch of places online, I decided to try Nail Envy based on the reviews it had.\\n\\nEverything that people say is 100% true.  Convenience? Amazing.  It is so incredibly easy to make a same day appointment online and get confirmation of it - I've never gotten that luxury from any other salon.  Their service? Exceptional.  I had trouble locating the place since I am new in town and Nick was incredibly helpful on the phone and it was no problem that I ended up being a little late for my appointment time. In addition, everyone speaks perfect English and is very interactive with their clients holding conversations with them and it was apparent they truly care about and know their clientele very well which, in my opinion, sets them apart.\\n\\nThe quality?  Unbelievable.  I stuck with a regular manicure for the first time just to test out the place and see if I liked it.  If the quality of a regular manicure is this good I can't imagine the quality of a gel manicure which is what I will be getting every few weeks from this point forward at Nail Envy.  In addition, it is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN without sacrificing comfort.  Finally, the prices are some of the best I've seen in the area in all honesty.\\n\\nTwo thumbs WAY up and a round of applause.  Needless to say, I found my nail place here in Henderson and will be a regular customer as of today. \\n\\nA big thank you to Nail Envy for truly exceptional business operations!"}
{"label":1,"text":"We are a family of 4 with two small children and had my brother visiting. Most high-end Montreal hotels accept up to 4 guests per room even for suites. I had a hard time finding a room for 5. This Westin was the only one that had a suite with two double beds and a sleeper sofa for 5 guests. The room was spacious and nicely appointed, but came with a high price tag. Although they charged for the 5th person, there were only 4 sets of bedding and towels. The sleeper sofa had crumbs of chips and other junk food under bottom cushions. The room was never made the next morning. When we requested extra bedding and the room be cleaned, nobody came for 30 minutes. Concierge hesitated to recommend restaurants frequented by locals and not by tourists and insisted on going to canned places on the map. The highlight of our stay was the swimming pool. The bottom of the pool can be seen from the hotel entrance on the atrium ceiling as if it was a fish tank. There were 3 pools - a heated one for swimming, a large hot tub and a tub with cold water. That made our kid's weekend. Gym looked very nice, though we never used it. We stayed at many nice suites at other locations within similar price range and always had a wonderful time. We expected a lot more from a reputable name like Westin for a higher end room. That said, it's a nice option for business travellers. I wouldn't recommend it for family weekend away."}
{"label":2,"text":"Went to dinner here on a Tuesday night. I'm gluten free (not by choice) and our server was really great about going through my options. He was also great about checking back with us and asking us how everything was without being too present. I think his name was Ryan? Definitely a great server. The seating is pretty awesome too, especially if you're on a date. They have semi-enclosed booths that are great for a more private dining experience. The food was pretty good. We got the NY strip and the Cioppino. For the price I expected the Cioppino to have a little more shellfish and not so many onions and peppers. The steak had great flavor and was cooked as ordered. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the bartender. I myself can be quite a loud talker but the restaurant was very quiet and she was talking to her two guests at the bar so loudly that it ruined the experience for us. The bar isn't far from the tables but the whole dinner we got to hear about her allergies and how she loves to drink and how she doesn't fit in with the people in Austin. I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and I completely understand connecting to and having a conversation with your guest. And to her credit she was friendly but her speaking voice was so ridiculously loud we could barely have our own conversation. We actually rushed through our meal just so we could get out of there! The last thing I want to hear about when I'm eating dinner is how sick you got the last time your allergies flared up. There's a fine line between outgoing and obnoxious. If we went back we'd be sure to sit further away from the bar. Overall decent food and good service."}

They have a nice selection from NODA and Birdsong Brewery.\\n\\nIf you have a dog that is nicely behaved, then venture out to the Dog Bar.

It is really great to be able to go out to a bar and bring your dog with you.\\n\\nLove this place!"}

{"label":0,"text":"We signed up our baby girl for the intro swim class towards the end of June.  She attended at least 2 swim classes without incident.  She enjoyed the classes and we even gave the instructor a gratuity. We missed swim class for the July 4th weekend and when we returned for the next week's class, some child made a bowel movement in the pool & class was cancelled - understandable.  This happened for the next 3 weeks (all classes we paid for and were promised we could make up).  Then, we paid for August's lessons on or about July 27, 2014. \\n\\nOnly after we paid for August lessons were we telephoned (on our about July 30, 2014)  & informed that our baby had been \\\"under suspicion\\\" for making the bowel movements in the pool.  Mind you, our baby is exclusively breast fed & did not make solid bowel movements at all for those weeks.  Instructors who specialize in teaching infants should be somewhat familiar with the biological functions & physical development of infants.  When I spoke to the manager, Adam, about this, he seemed bewildered at the notion that an exclusively breast fed infant would not make a solid poop.\\n\\nSecond, we always dressed our baby in the approved, reusable swim diaper.  I have checked her diaper after each lesson and there has never been any trace of any bowel movement, nor are the elastics loose around her legs & waist.  Instead, the swim diaper is quit snug - so snug it leave indentations in her skin after class.  The only difference between the swim diaper we used and the School's swim diaper that they sell is that ours was white and theirs has a pattern.    \\n\\nThirdly, it was only after we paid for August lessons that we were informed that we were \\\"under suspicion\\\" and informed that we were no longer welcome at the pool.   I understand the school has a no refund policy but we feel as though we were swindled - they took our money for August and then 3 days later told us we were not welcome!  Nevermind the fact that class was cancelled for 3 times in July & we never got a refund for those classes!  Why take our money for August classes and then 3 days later tell us that we are not welcome to return?  \\n\\nWe have spoken to management on at least 3 occasions just regarding the refund.  Last week, on approximately August 4, 2014, I was advised that we would get a refund for August.  The manager asked whether I wanted it picked up or mailed.  I asked them to mail it.  When we did not receive it as of Thursday, August 8, we called again and were told that the refund was mailed on Wednesday, August 7.  When it did not arrive as of Monday, August 11, we called again and were told \\\"no refunds\\\".  Apparently, the school representative lied to us when she said it was mailed on Wednesday.  Now they say that they will see what they can do and have a manager call us. We may have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \\n\\nThis place is not good for infants as they do not understand infant development."}

One of the things *I* like about Natural Stitches is that you can go in and browse without any interference BUT there is always someone to help if you ask.

On the good side the waitress gave us 20% off our bill for some reason. \\nIm not sure if Vegas has a good korean bbq spot but I know for a fact the Vietnamese joints are as good as in LA.  \\n\\noh ya ... this place is open 24\/7."}
{"label":0,"text":"Decided to give this place another chance after a terrible experience last time I visited the previous location. The new building had a funky odor going on inside so we opted for patio seating. As soon as we sat ourselves at one of the 7 open tables we were approached my a manager saying that we had to wait to be seated by the hostess. Upon mentioning all the vacant tables he told us that they were in the process of \\\"tracking down\\\" those people to seat them. So we stood up and lingered until we were given permission to sit back down at the same table. \\nThe table side guac was great but the server never returned to take our order for entrees. We finally flagged down the manager who apologized and began taking our order until the server ran over to relieve him of her duty. He then told her how embarrassed he was for having to do that...awkward. We then continued to wait for our food for 30 minutes before I finally called the manager over again and told him they obviously forgot our order somewhere and we wanted to leave. For the negative experience he comped us a round of cheap girly shots (Washington apples or something) and presented the rest of the $25 bill."}
{"label":2,"text":"Food and atmosphere are both good, but this location (DC Ranch) has some fundamental problems with it's service.  It is very disorganized and there is poor communication among the staff.   Tonight there was preferential treatment given to another party ( I think money exchanged hands previously, or it was just a very awkward handshake I witnessed ), which caused my party to wait longer.  It was embarrassing when we were escorted to the table that was sat with the party who came in after was and we were told we had to keep waiting.  It was obvious what had happened.  The manager handled the situation the best he could but the entire ordeal was frustrating and uncomfortable."}

{"label":4,"text":"Birthday celebrations should be done up big and Beso definitely fits that description. From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.\\n\\nWe got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.\\n\\nWhen the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.\\n\\nFor entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  \\n\\nThis is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele."}

There were 5 of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share. This dish I chose was the lamb masala! AMAZING!! Very sweet\/spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable. Overall great experience and will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet!"}
{"label":1,"text":"hmmmm, what's all the fuss about?\\n\\nok, first off the staff is very friendly and helpful, they are good people.\\n\\nThat said, the bbq, is just lacking. We ordered Le gros, with the burned ends poutine.\\n\\nLe gros pretty much has everything, ribs, pulled pork and chicken. Mac n cheese, fried green, fries, coleslaw, baked beans, and pickles. The burned ends poutine had pulled pork.\\n\\nIt all sounds impressive, and having read they won some gold medal at some bbq competition... honestly, the ribs were dry, the meat was tough and not fall of the bones at all. That's the most disappointing thing really. then the pulled pork which was moist and good but then some pieces were clearly sliced, which doesn't give it the same texture as pulled...\\n\\nthe roast chicken was the only thing I liked, it was moist and tasted good. The coleslaw was nothing special, fries were very good. The baked beans, well it seems they put some sort of herbs in it which I did not like, and they were a bit too tangy for me... \\n\\nThere are two bottles of bbq sauce on the table, a sweet one and a spicy one. I guess you're supposed to add it to the meat and eat, so you only put as much as you need... I'm not fond of this set up, I like my bbq drenched in the sauce as it cooks so the sauce permeates the meat, just my thoughts... and yes even with dry rub you brush some sauce on there to finish it off before serving!!! yeah all the meat had no bbq sauce on them!!!  whatchou talkin bout  Willis?\\n\\nThe poutine was ok, not enough sauce and pulled pork didn't add anything, was I supposed to add the bbq sauce on the poutine?\\n\\nI was hoping for something good, but even for dry rub, ribs should not be so dry and tough to eat... did I get a bad batch?"}

We wanted to arrive early to obtain good seats.... we should have listened when they said don't arrive to 30-45 minutes early.. THERE IS NOTHING HERE.. it is strictly a bus depot, with the characters you except to see, the homeless, the trying to get home, the runaways - speaking of ... there was entire wall just dedicated to run a away children.. well that just ruined my weekend.

{"label":2,"text":"This review is based solely on Sandbar as a nightlife spot, I didn't eat there, just drank, heavily, and danced, heavily, and based on my few moments of clarity between shots these are my thoughts....\\n\\nSandbar offers some great music and a dance floor to get your groove on.  It's only been open a week so it was packed! If you don't get there before 10 pm expect to wait in a long line and not find a table to park your drinks at.  The ambience is very cool and it is pretty big, there actually are a lot of tables both inside and out. There are 4 cabanas on the outside patio that you can reserve if you have a large group and promise to spend at least $300, which is very easy to do with a large group. The sand and small pool are a nice touch, I did get a little sand in my shoes but didn't mind one bit. The dance floor isn't huge but it doesn't get too packed we always found a spot to comfortably shake our groove things, the DJ plays hip hop, some rock and even a little country while they show the videos on the flat screens, they even played SNL's digital short On a Boat with Andy Samberg & T-Pain which is very danceable and very hilarious.  \\n\\nNow we did have a few issues but I think it's based on the fact that this place is new and so so packed and management did try to make amends so I'm not going to knock them too much for it. It was my sister's birthday so we called in advance to reserve a cabana for the night but then they called us back a day later and said they had actually overbooked so we no longer had the cabana, we then made reservations for dinner but once we got there they did not have a spot for us to sit, they had anticipated another big party would leave before we got there and they did not, so we had to go somewhere else for food, but the manager offered my sister free drinks when we came back later and they did reserve us some high tops by the dance floor when we came back so that was nice. We never had to wait too long for our waitress to come back around and offer more drinks either, another plus.\\n\\nAlso because it is so packed there is more of a possibility of having a few knucklheads in the crowd, we actually saw a fight early in the night, small and squashed quickly. Then later in the evening some drunky tried to fight a guy in our group, I think this drunky had little man complex and he was in the crowd and he bumped into our friend at the same time that someone else bumped into him so he thought our friend purposely bumped him. Our friend was actually the designated driver so he was completely sober and the drunk 5 foot tall guy tried to fight the sober 6 foot tall guy who kept telling him to walk away, which he did, only to come back later with his 5 1\/2 foot tall friend to avenge him. It was all stupid and the management could see that it was just two drunk guys trying to prove they weren't scared of the big guy and they kicked the knuckleheads out and let us stay.  The night was saved and we actually stayed until the last song at 2 a.m. chit chatting and dancing the night away.\\n\\nI will definitely go back, maybe not for a few weeks when it isn't so crowded but with it being one of the few dance spots in Chandler this probably won't happen any time soon, which is good for them. We went on a Saturday but I've heard Friday is just as packed."}

I work for Food Network and I could not pass up a chance to eat here. Plus, Derek Bocking of Top Chef Canada fame was sitting nearby. Martin, not there at the time.. alas.\\n\\nThe first thing to note is that they hoarded the English speakers to the front. This is understandable, so the waitress could speak to us all, but she chose to do so.. in an interesting way. She would address us, along with the two tables on either side simultaneously. Interesting approach. The washroom is unmarked, I needed help to find, and the floor was SLICK with grease. A friend we made in line wiped out the second he walked in. Oh, also the air reaks of rendering pig fat.. but if you can make it past all of this.. there is the food. \\n\\nthe SO and I, having waited to 11pm to eat dinner, were famished and over ordered. The smoked sausage starter was really outstanding. I am German and well versed on smoked sausage. It was sour, and perfect. \\n\\nI enjoyed the French onion soup which was mostly bubbling cheese (yum) and a delicious rosemary infused broth. There were chunks fo pork in it which I found detracted from the soup. Still, really good. \\n\\nSpecial tuna \\\"handroll\\\" with chopped tuna, nori, rice, fish eggs and quail egg. Ridiculous. Best handroll I have ever had. \\n\\nMy main was a special, a tuna with eggplant and tomato. It was really good, albiet slightly overcooked. The SO had a pot of various pig bits on mashed potato. he liked it other than the blood sausage which he found only ok (although just recently back from a Blood fueled fiesta in Germany) We were too full to finish and unable to at 1am.

I would give that one star if I could, but the bread and eggplant that came with the biryani made up for it. The biryani tasted like it was DAYS old. The peas inside looked shriveled and old. The chicken had a weird crust on it that only old food gets. You all know what I mean. I'm sure they had made it days prior and microwaved it for us.

I was in a bit of a hurry so I can see why they did not offer to punch any more holes into the belt for me but the next day when I tried it on with a much smaller dress, it was a little too big.

{"label":2,"text":"A lively, modern space, DLUX impresses when it comes to ambiance.  The large 4-sided bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, literally. Semi-circle booths and small rectangular tables line three of the walls, leaving a small front area open for a happy hour crowd standing and mingling. \\n\\nDLUX was running a 15min wait at 7pm on a Tuesday, not surprising given how few tables there actually are when it gets down to it; the place is not as big as it appears from the outside.  I liked the decor and lighting, it pulses with urban energy.  Purse hooks tucked under the bar are always a nice touch, as is validated parking at one of the nearby ramps (be sure to refer to the website to make sure you park in the right one!)  \\n\\nThe menu is primarily burgers, with a few salads (all of which included meat, although I'm sure you could ask for it without, but then you're paying for protein you're not getting, but I digress...) Plenty of vegetarian options with the burgers, as they allow a free substitution to a portabella on any of their tasty concoctions. There is also a Portabella Caprese burger on the menu along with a White Bean burger, which was excellent.  The size of the burger was good for me, but probably a tad small for a strapping lad who may want to opt for the upgrade to a double (+$3). No sides come with these burgers (all $8) so if you want fries with that plan on +$2.  I'm fine with that, I don't need\/want a pound of fries with my dinner anyways!\\n\\nThe burgers and ambiance were a solid 4*, it was the service that was a bummer.  I was surprised, given the very friendly and cheerful host staff and all the positive accolades on the service listed here.  Hopefully our experience was just a fluke.\\n\\nThe trouble began when we ordered an appetizer to start (spinach dip) and then burgers & beer.  The beers came... then the burgers... THEN the appetizer (Marissa's pet peeve #92 - they call it a \\\"starter\\\" for a reason, folks, if it was supposed to come after you got your dinner it would be called \\\"dessert\\\").  \\n\\nNow, I understand that kitchen crews sometimes make things out of order or a server puts in a whole order at once instead of staggering their entries... BUT this is server 101 - when poor timing happens you either:\\na) correct it with the kitchen staff before it even gets to the table or \\nb) apologize to the table for things being out of order and figure out a way to remedy it.  \\n\\nEither of these can help negate pet peeve #92.  However, when neither of those things happen and the server brings the burgers and then returns with the appetizer, without a word of acknowledgement that things are out of order or an apology, well, I'd like to introduce you to Marissa's pet peeve #107.  Either:\\n a) the server will hope I don't notice that my \\\"starter\\\" just became my \\\"ender\\\" or \\nb) she doesn't care or \\nc) she doesn't know any better.  \\n\\nHmm.  I've got a problem with any of those options. All that being said, I liked the energy and ambiance of the place and my burger was good.  I'd give DLUX another shot but I know whose section I'd avoid.  Wink wink."}

Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.\\n\\nContinuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...\\n\\nI know the patio has a nice people\/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place."}
{"label":4,"text":"I started seeing Ricky because my Mom recommended him.  She had been going to him for a while and always looked great so I checked him out. I have been very happy with him ever since.  He also does a wonderful job with my kids ( ages 6 and 3).  He is very patient and listens to what we want.  I even trusted him enough to cut my hair on live news for a donation event he was doing.  We donated my hair and he gave me a beautiful A line bob.  I couldn't be happier with him and recommend you check him out!"}
{"label":4,"text":"I've been going to this salon now for about 2 months, and I just love it!  Of course, not every experience is going to be phenomenal, so when I went to this salon for a fill and gel manicure two weeks ago, I was not overly pleased.  The manicure took 2 hours and the end result was less than desirable.  The owner, Barbara, was so understanding of the situation, and took $10 off the total bill, for which I was grateful.  Not being one to completely write off a place due to one bad experience, I called again to make an appointment (with a different nail tech) for the day of, which was booked, so I made an appointment for the following day.  Not long after, I received a call from the salon stating a time had opened up with Barbara if I still wanted it, which I accepted.  Barbara is such a nice person in general to sit and chat with, but she does an amazing job as well!  I was in and out of the salon on my lunch break from work, and because of my previous experience, she didn't charge for the service.  It's refreshing to see an owner that takes so much pride in the quality of her business!  Overall, I'm honestly very happy to have found this salon to get my nails done, and I would recommend this business to anyone!"}
{"label":1,"text":"This was actually the first of many venues visited by myself and my fiance (now husband) for our wedding ceremony.  The photos online look amazing, and we were anxious to visit the property.  We called and made an appointment, and arrived a couple of minutes early.  We stood in front of the open door of the office for nearly 20 minutes, all the while the two employees inside (who could clearly see us) joked and laughed.  We finally stepped out back to take a tour ourselves.  \\n\\nWe were not nearly as impressed as we thought we would be.  The place is in need of major repairs, and the attention to detail just isn't there.  The windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, as they were coated with smears, fingerprints, goop-like substances, and a layer of the desert's dust.  The floor of the main ball room was absolutely disgusting, and the women's and men's bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE (seriously, they smelled like a well-used Port-A-Potty after midnight at an all-you-can-eat deep-fried sausage event).  \\n\\nWe were just about to walk out the door when one of the two employees who had been jibber-jabbering in the office came to stop us.  When we told her that it was over 30 minutes past our appointment time and we needed to get going, she inquired as to why we just didn't come into her office and sit down.  Really?  So it's our fault that we didn't begin the meeting on time?  We told her that the place just didn't look how we expected it to look. She remarked that they had had a big event the weekend before, and that the place still hadn't been cleaned.  That might be true, but there were things that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!  \\n\\nFurther, the \\\"castle\\\" is situated in an industrial area which is currently under construction.  If you're planning an event that does not take place in the evening, construction noise is a very real possibility."}

I had a picture of what I wanted my nails to look like and Lily went above and beyond what I wanted for my mani. The receptionist was also super nice and helped me pick out perfect colors. There was so much time and care spent on me it was an absolutely perfect experience. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'd give more stars if I could."}
{"label":3,"text":"By far!! Big Al's is the best restaurant inside The Orleans Hotel & Casino.  After walking around the Casino looking for something to eat without heading to the strip, we walked pass Al's.  The menu looked interesting and inviting.\\n\\nOur waitress was very helpful and friendly, giving us several great suggestions on the menu, which we used wisely.  \\n\\nI started with a cup of some of the best Boston Clam Chowder I've had outside the New England area.  It was smooth and creamy with lots of lovely calms.  The flavors were very delightful, light, but filling.\\n\\nNext I partook the Soft-shell Crab Po Boy, Fresh French bread with two large lightly beer-battered crabs, cleaned and prepared perfectly.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and sweet the crab tasted. Beautiful red tomato slices and crisp lettuce and a zesty Creole mayo spread.\\n\\nAlso ordered at the table was the Louisiana Crab Cakes with a Creole mustard sauce.  I had few of bites of these also. The cakes were fairly large and of good thickness.  There were lumps of sweet crabmeat, and not \\\"krab\\\".  The veggies were finely diced, as I prefer.  I hate biting into large chucks of veggies.  Great seasoning was used as well, spicy, but not too hot.\\n\\nI will definitely roll back over to Big Al's from The Strip the next time I'm in Vegas.  For the quality of the meal and the good prices, $12 for the Po Boy (2 large crabs) and another $12 for two good size crab cakes with real crab lump meat. I'll be a repeat customer."}

I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful.

{"label":1,"text":"Went there for dinner on Monday night.  Not real impressed.  The place is not much larger than a Golden Corral.  Being sort of cheap I usually stay at Excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet.  Last Christmas I decided to spend an extra $5 and try the buffet at the Luxor and was well rewarded.  So this year I opted to spend yet another $5 ($26.99 +tax) to see what it got me.  Last year at the Luxor was much better.  Very small salad bar. Limited cooked vegetables.  Several meat and starch dishes, almost all were cold or lukewarm.  Several of the seafood items (hot and cold) were soggy.  I did leave room for dessert and it was very good.  This place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well.  They have several seafood offerings, they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out.  I ate between the opening rush and the 7PM dinner rush so the place was only about 80% full and the lines were reasonable.  My server kept my plates cleared and my Iced tea full.  I did notice this trip the entire MGM family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when I was there in July."}

All the things that make an ice cream shop great are present and accounted for.\\n\\n1. They make everything in-house.\\n2. Service is nice!\\n3. A huge variety of flavors, although not necessary. Still nice to see things like taro, black sesame, and Rocher.\\n4. They have boba.\\n5. They can spice up your ice cream with waffles - regular and red velvet!\\n6. They even make their own waffle cones. Pretty easy but cool.\\n7. Stamp cards.\\n8. I'm not sure if this is a plus or not since I haven't tried them but they have egg rolls and other snacks in case you're hungry for something greasy.\\n\\nI got a triple scoop waffle bowl with stracciatella, \\\"Rocher\\\" (yes the golden foil-wrapped chocolates), and Reese's PB cup flavor. The stracciatella was delicious, the Rocher really tasted just like a Rocher! Imagine my surprise. Reese's was a really nice peanut butter flavor with chocolate bits. I really liked all of them! It was all washed down with a Thai tea boba. Boba was good, though I prefer it firmer. It was a little bit away from mushy. Thai tea itself was fine.\\n\\nIf there was anything I didn't like it was the sweetness of the ice cream itself. It was a bit too much for me but I bet most people will be ok with it. Also, I think vegan flavors would be awesome (that aren't just sorbets) since so many people are lactose intolerant! Myself included. It's a tough product to make well, though.\\n\\nI'd be back!

{"label":2,"text":"I was disappointed with my experience, but I'm willing to give it another shot.\\n\\nThe main problem was our waiter. We had very slow service. We were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus. I ordered coffee and half-and-half, but I didn't get a spoon or something to stir it with, which I thought was odd. I just kind of swished it around... It was weird.\\n\\nOur waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. \\n\\nWe also ordered pie. Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset. Their other waiter must have made that mistake. I went for the key lime pie which was delicious. The Fat Elvis was replaced with a drumstick (?) which I guess was good, but I don't like peanut butter. \\n\\nAnother thing is if you sit outside, they will give you plastic silverware. I didn't mind, but others in my party did. Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good, but the service was not. Andrew K attempted to show off his humor (\\\"Elvis has left the building\\\"), but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting. I'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside, but I feel he could have paid a bit more attention."}

Because I was feeling a little queasy, (my stomach was being an asshole) I decided to just go with the pilsner 22oz for $11. I read that some Fat Tuesdays offer samples. When I asked for samples, the server told me that he usually only gives one sample, but for me he would allow me to have two samples. I did not feel special. Allowing me to get 2 samples is no big whoop. I decided on Mango and Rum. It was pretty good! The mango was very prominent in slushie. I must say, I was pretty full by the time I finished it. I did not feel a buzz at all. So much for the rum, eh? My friend got a peach bellini. Now that one was pretty dang good.

I pass up the closer Filly B's to go here. Not anymore.\\n\\nIn the last 6 months it has REALLY gone downhill in quality, and service isn't too far behind. Tonight we, again, wasted over $35 on food that was un-edible. Of all we ordered, 1 shrimp burrito was *almost* finished out of hunger. The other shrimp burrito was beyond the normal heat that accompanies it. It was SO flaming, spicy hot it was un edible. It burns just thinking about it today, and I like a bit of heat normally. Even my husband who loves HOT said it was too hot.\\n\\nThe super nachos were ruined by horrible tasting beans...they were very old, \\\"antiseptic\\\" tasting and bitter. The dark brown, over fried and many burnt chips didn't help. The nachos were trashed.\\n\\nWorst of everything was the 2 orders of menudo. The meat was disgusting- over cooked, slimy, fatty pieces of nasty, cheap meat- there was no honeycomb tripe barely at all. I wouldn't even feed it to my begging dogs. It was like having a mouthful of hot slime, I had to spit out. It was gag worthy. (3 weeks ago it was delicious- tender but firm, a good blend of mostly honeycomb\/lining )  The last 2 weeks we've ordered the menudo its been wasted. It didn't even taste like it had been cleaned well. Perhaps they were serving reheated menudo from last week- who knows.. Even the lemons tonight were slimy, broken down & squished...rotten in spots where they were brown.\\n\\nI can't begin to tell you how many times its been bad and food has been wasted in the last 6 months. I'm finally at my wits end...we've probably wasted close to $200+ in food in the last several months- 70$ in the last month alone.

{"label":1,"text":"What a disappointment. I have lived in the area for a few years now I was hoping to get a new bar\/restaurant that would price itself for the neighborhood. Sadly, the prices for food are so high, and the return for your dollar so low it is just not worth going there no matter how good the food is, and it wasn't (that good). I do not foresee a long run of business for these people here.\\n\\nWalking in was like walking into a dungeon, very dark and honestly you could trip over things. Since this was formerly a Timbers, the d\\u00e9cor was that \\\"North Western\\\" hack you expect from a Timbers, nothing interesting. The bar had  the requisite Video Poker games and what looked to be a shallow well. The Spirits list included some very pricey bottles (including Dom at $400) that I would suppose would never sell in this neighborhood. The wines were an eclectic list and priced rather high, so not sure who they buy from but it is off beat. As for beers, well, I worked at a bar that had 700 different beers and was not impressed. I think the Smiths Ale was the only eye raiser. Also in there list was a subsection \\\"cans\\\", I have never seen this even though it is common for British Cream Ales and such to come in cans, it's not mentioned. So the bar area, nothing special and a bit eerie, but that's my opinion.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant, the prices were too high, period. The claim made by the waiter (this had to have been his first service job) that all the food was fresh made was a complete lie. The food was Sysco re-heat and eat restaurant selections without a doubt. Of the burger dinner I did have, MAYBE the patty was hand formed and 1\/3 pound. It came with sweet potato fries (undercooked) and fried pickle chips on the burger (so they  were soggy), and the bacon tasted reheated by dropping it in the fryer for  a few seconds. This was $14.\\n\\nMy wife wanted Linguini Alfredo and it came with garlic bread. This also was $14. Yeah, that's all, pasta (not fresh), Alfredo Sauce (if that was made fresh then there is something seriously wrong with the cook) and of course they weren't about to bake bread. But are we missing something? Where is the protein?

Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. \\n\\nSo it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.\\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL\\n\\nThere was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!\\n\\nWe started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.\\n\\nThings started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. \\n\\nFirst it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, \\\"oh yeah.\\\"  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. \\n\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). \\n\\nThe current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. \\n\\nOur bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. \\n\\nNow why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?

{"label":1,"text":"This is a 2.5 star review. Bistro tex-mex. Ain't it grand?\\n\\nThe booths are comfy, the interior is chill and low-light, service varies from great to distracted, and the menu is huge (including a large-ish Veg selection, plus their open-mindedness about subs and alterations). But being as huge a fan of the mexican flavor set as I am, it hurts my soul to see it bandied about, willy-nilly. At least they aren't claiming to be \\\"authentic\\\", as some other high-end places in this town declare - Mexican inspired is pretty accurate.\\n\\nSo I get my order of veggie enchiladas with tomatillo salsa and, although its interesting, there's so much happening in my mouth that with every bite, I'm scratching my head a little harder. To start, they use the same veg mix in all their vegetarian dishes - a finely shredded mix of shrooms, zuch, sweet plantains, pepper. Corn, even. Things are cooked down to an unrecognizable pile of whatever. Too sweet. Pair that with a very carefully opposite of hot green sauce and super mild queso fresco, and you've got the idea - there's no bright, interesting ooomph to tie the dish together, and it needs it, badly.\\n\\nOther stuff I've had makes me think I'm eating a Big Mac (yeah, its been a while, but still)- the plantain side \\\"salad\\\" is too much, too sweet, 15 flavors all at once that collide and become gastronomic mush. There's sugar, or sweetening agents, in so many things here. Rice, even. Sheesh.\\n\\nThey did make me a torta con huevos y queso, no arguments, although it wasn't on the menu. It was tasty and messy - reminded me of Chicago style rather than NY. \\n\\nThe salsa is bland, but the chips are perfect. They have a jalapeno margarita (6$) that is probably the spiciest thing on the menu (but isn't, really)."}

{"label":3,"text":"I found this place for dinner in Edinburgh because I know how much the other half loves wines and wine bars. A friend had suggested quite a few places for dinner, but none of them seemed overly exciting to him, so we came here.\\n\\nWe came in on a Thursday night around 6:30 and the place was already quite busy. For me, that's a sign of a good place! We were seated at a table, and quite soon afterwards a large party came in, so we all shifted around to give them more seating (which turned out to be a HUGE mistake). \\n\\nWe started with a bottle of English white wine and a cheese plate. It consisted of three cheese. We chose it over the meat and cheese plate solely because that one contained manchego and gorganzola. Both nice cheeses, but nothing special. One of the people at the other table really wasn't paying any attention to anything around her except chatting while trying to get up, so she knocked a bottle of water over onto our cheese plate. They did end up getting us another cheese plate (which hey, it might have been cheese overload, but oh well), which consisted of four cheeses instead of three. And two of them were different. It's a bit strange that they opted to give us the manchego and gorganzola on the second plate in place of one of the cheeses, but maybe they were out.\\n\\nWe then ordered some Italian red wine and the spaghetti with salami in a garlic cream sauce and the ham risotto. It took awhile due to the large table next to us, but we weren't in a hurry so we just enjoyed our wine. The mains were good. We also split the sticky toffee pudding at the end with some port, and that was probably the least good thing of the night. It wasn't sticky enough for me!\\n\\nThe table of twelve next to us kind of ballooned into around 20 by the end. It was a bit too much for such a small restaurant. I kind of wish they told them they couldn't accommodate such a large party, but I don't even think they thought it was going to get as big as it did! \\n\\nThe owner (I think he was the owner, who knows?) came up to us at the end, and he started talking with us a bit about wine.

The tacos were waaaay better than Roberto's, which seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in this general area aside from Baja Fresh.\\n\\nThe sope was good too, it had a whole tomato slice on top which was kind of weird but still good. \\n\\nI also got an horchata. I have been craving some homemade horchata so it was only natural I try it out. It was just okay, I think it may have tasted better a few hours prior to my arrival because it was a little watery but you can still taste the milk base and sweetness. \\n\\nAll in all it was 10 dollars for my feast, and it was well worth the price.

The place was pretty packed, it was a short wait in a good sized line to get to the food counter.  Once there they will ask you if you have been there before.  If not, they will offer you tastings of the meats and explain the serving to you. There may be several new comers so you will have to deal will people who want to try everything because they don't know what they want. That is irritating but expected.  As it was our first time at Rudy's we wanted to try several items.  We ordered Cutter's Brisket, Turkey, regular Sausage, Rudy's pinto beans, green chili, potato salad, coleslaw & a micro brew bottle beer. They have plenty of beer and beverage choices. Everything was good but the stand out for me was the Turkey.  Get the Turkey! it had excellent flavor and smokiness while remaining moist and tender.  The brisket was dry and not as flavorful. The beans were good but not great. I like great beans. the Coleslaw was very good. The potato salad was my least favorite.  The sausage was huge and it had great flavor.  They offer their brand of BBQ sauce in Sissy or Original (a bit more spicy).  I compare this place to Texas BBQ House, where the brisket is much more flavorful and moist. They do not offer Turkey however. I also like the flavor and consistency of Texas BBQ House's BBQ sauce much better.  Rudy's was good, not a negative experience, I just had higher hopes for a full flavor of brisket I get elsewhere. I prefer Texas BBQ House over Rudy's.  Give Rudy's a try and see what you think."}

{"label":0,"text":"I wish that I could give a negative star. Honestly, I never wanted century link in the first place. However, my apartments are contracted with them and try as I might no other service would agree to bend the rules and sign me up. I hate century link because 1.) No, you can not make a payment 24\/7. You have to schedule it for a later time. 2.) If you are one day late, you are shut off immediately. However, once you make a payment you have to wait 4-24 hours to  get it back. 3.) Which this far has meant 24 hours although they have no problem pulling the money from my account immediately. 4.) They do not offer 24 hour support, their offices close at 6pm. 5.) It took me 2+ weeks to get it all hooked up because I was told 3 different things by 3 different people about what kind of modem I needed, which turned out to be only theirs. But lucky me, I can rent instead of buy! So over a years period, I will have paid for a modem that I can't keep. The alternative being to buy their modem, which why would I want to? So I can have a modem that only works for century link? Hahaha, no thank you. 6.) they refused to adjust my bill for the 2 weeks I paid for no internet due to customer service incompetence. They even hung up on me. 7.) Internet as low as $19.95? Bull, \\\"oh I'm sorry, your area code does not qualify\\\". Then why is there a billboard two blocks from me advertising it? If you're thinking about switching to century link, don't!"}

The acoustics are wonderful for live music, there's a lot of beautiful woodwork, and so the sound is live and warm.

Dad said the limo was complimentary... I have no idea. Dad did the research and made the reservations- I just tag along and eat.\\n\\nGARLIC LOAF: Loaf of homemade bread sliced and stuffed with garlic, Italian seasonings, mozzarella and parmesan cheese. It was VERY good, albeit a little salty\/garlic-y. And maybe a little too cheesy. But still delicious.\\n\\nOSSO BUCO: It literally is fall-off-the-bone good as the restaurant claims. Not too salty (which is a big thing for me). But the shank is HUGE.\\n\\nPORK CHOPS SICILIAN: I think Dad ordered this. Two 8 oz pork chops served with potatoes and vegetables. Definitely a man's meal.\\n\\nCIOPPINO: Very tasty dish comprised of fresh seafood including: lobster, clams, mussels, scallops, crab, cod, and shrimp. The soup part goes very well with bread (but I'm trying to lay off the carbs). I'm pretty sure Dad enjoyed it, though. He claimed he was stuffed, but kept dipping bread into the soup.\\n\\nDad also ordered a side of meatballs, which I heard were pretty good, too. There's just a little bit of spice in it to add a little kick, according to the waitress.\\n\\nThe waitress was extremely friendly, and there was live entertainment.

The food menu was largely burgers (and some of the best buffalo wings I have had in a long time) and large beers (24 ouncers).\\n\\nAfterwards, we headed upstairs to the gaming zone, an area with sports-ish video games.

{"label":2,"text":"I really loved Dr. Wareing when I had her. She was is super kind and attentive. She tended to ask a couple of times during the appointment, \\\"Do you have any other questions?\\\" She wanted to make sure I wasn't sitting at home worrying about anything. She has very good communication skills. The office staff has always been very kind in my experience as well.\\n\\nBut looking back at my experience I realized I wish she had been more cautious about my situation. I was having contractions for months. At my 36th week appointment she said I was dilated to 3 cm, offered to strip my membranes, but said she was going to send me to the hospital anyway, (and by the way, \\\"you know I'm going out out of the country tomorrow, right?). She acted like having the baby before 37 weeks was no big deal. This was my first, and I liked her, and I didn't know what to think so I just trusted my doctor. She did say that the baby might have problems latching, but sort of down played it. I don't know if she really didn't think it was that big of a deal or if she really thought I was going to have that baby that day and was trying not to stress me out. But the reality is when I got to the hospital and I wasn't dilating any more, instead of sending me home she broke my water and I had the baby later that night. I wouldn't say that she pressured me to have the baby early, but I was a first time mom and I needed someone to tell me what the smartest\/safest thing to do was. I didn't really get that.\\n\\nFor people that have complained that she only takes women who are pregnant, I can tell you that she probably already has too many patients as it is and you'd do better elsewhere. I would sometimes wait for an hour or more in the office if she was delivering a baby or something (only one Dr in the office and all). Plus, when I moved out of town and tried to get them to move my records. I have never had such a battle in my life. The (very kind) nurse at the desk said she was really sorry but Dr. Wareing had been delivering babies \\\"non-stop, getting no sleep\\\" that week and hadn't had time to sign off on my records. Finally my husband had to call and threaten to go all the way to Phoenix and stand in their office until they gave us the records. The sent them the next day. It took them 29 days."}

Luckily, we all survived the experience, but the service was exceptionally slow and the food was pretty disappointing. I thought you could never go wrong with fish & chips at a British pub, but mine didn't have any flavor at all. The server felt bad that we had to wait so long so she brought us all plates of \\\"chip butties\\\" which are just french fries on a buttered roll. Don't knock it til you try it... that was actually better than most of our meals.\\n\\nThis place does seem fun as a bar since they had Monday night football on and people were very into it."}
{"label":3,"text":"Yet another great Charlotte restaurant I'm not sure why I've yet to review. As a sushi aficionado the Cowfish is an obvious choice. They've taken it upon themselves to lead the fusion charge in a seriously unexpected direction by mixing the delicious creatures of the land and sea in one meal for us to delight in. Well, at the time of this review I suppose it's safe to say most fusion sushi joints have pretty much joined the \\\"let's add beef to our sushi\\\" bandwagon. But as far as I'm concerned, not only was The Cowfish first, but it still stands in my mind as the best.\\n\\nFirst off, there's getting in here. You've essentially gotta reserve a table. Don't walk up thinking \\\"I've heard of this pace and have to check it out, I'll go in!\\\" You will be hard pressed to find a table or even a spot at the bar on most nights. They book up quick and keep a waiting line out the door in most cases. It's all for good reason. There is an experience point to the place as well you know. Interior layout and decor is great. Comical actually, especially if you read a little Japanese and are familiar with the culture. The posters specifically are entertaining. Also, don't forget to take a trip to the restroom while you're here. You can relieve yourself to the sounds of random phrases spoken in English then in Chinese. It's...seriously random. They aren't even useful phrases. You'd pee yourself laughing if you weren't already peeing.\\n\\nService has been stellar in my experience so far. I've accompanied plenty of out-of-towners here and anytime somebody in the party hasn't been here before the waitstaff gives you a rundown of the menu, lots of recommendations and generally what to expect when you read the word \\\"burgushi\\\". This is great considering the menu is margin-to-margin on most pages and never-ending with options. I'm a sushi guy so naturally I gravitate towards the burgushi options. Surf 'n Turf is my personal go to favorite. It's like comfort food at the end of a long week. Angus beef tops a roll filled with salmon, tuna and cream cheese flash fried to the perfect texture. Or try the Lamb-urgushi. The name alone is funny enough to make you do it.\\n\\nThey've got a full bar that basically wraps around 3\/4 of the restaurant. No small part of that is a sushi bar and half of the bar-top is laden with built in touchable gaming screens with lots to choose from. Outdoor seating abound for the warmer days and enclosed outdoor seating for the cold and wet days. If you're passing through, check it out, but if you live here you owe it to yourself as a Charlottean to come here at least once."}

The server was nice enough and well timed though he didn't ask if we'd ever been there before to offer some info.\\n\\nThen the food came out.  With the exception of a hum-drum tomato sauce on our veggie \\\"thinbread\\\" pizza, the flavors were excellent.  The house dressing on the salad was great, and my European \\\"deepdish\\\" (no tomato sauce) tasted superb.  But let me backup - it's not a deepdish.  AT ALL.  It's a normal pizza with bread walls.  And the thincrust wasn't a thincrust either!!  They were both just normal pizzas.  EPIC FAIL.  Deepdish should require a fork and a knife.  I used my hands, easily.  Therefore I received half the food I was expecting.\\n\\nOn the upside, they offer half-pitchers of Oak Creek beers, which is a big win.  That and the flavors on my European were all that stood between this place and one less star.  The only people that can possibly rate this place well have never had a real thincrust or deepdish pizza."}

Wasn't real fond of the sweet pineapple salsa on the pork, but I just dug that off after the first bite and poured on the salsa.  The reason for the 3 stars you ask?  Parking absolutely sucks.  I mean it took us as long to park as it did to eat our tacos.  And then of course you have to pay to park, which sucks some more.  Just for that reason, I wouldn't go back.

{"label":4,"text":"This hidden gem of a brewery is a welcomed edition to the expanding Downtown district of Las Vegas.  Located next to the Heart Attack Grill on Fremont Street, this unassuming brewpub is a welcoming local spot to stop by for some amazing brews paired with some truly incredible gourmet popcorn (I love the Dill Pickle flavor).  Before you get yourself too involved with this review...you should know that Banger Brewing is a beer-only zone.  A craft brewery.  A beer bar.  Not a watering hole hammering out fruity cocktails and pouring pre-chilled shots from Jaggermeister mini-fridges.  If you're looking to drink tequila out of a stranger's belly button or drag along your 21 year old girlfriend who only drinks amaretto sours and raspberry kamikazes then this most likely isn't the place for you.  That being said...the beer is good.  Real good.  All 7 of their beers are brewed on site including options ranging from the smoothly unpretentious  American Pale Ale, \\\"Perfect Ten\\\" (ABV 6.2%) to the rich, coffee and caramel laden \\\"Simply Stout\\\" (ABV 6.0%).  My personal favorite is the Sandia Watermelon Wheat (ABV 5.1%).  The happy and helpful bartender assured me it's mixed with fresh watermelon to give it that crisp, clean and in-no-way-fake watermelon flavor.  The Jalapeno Hefeweizen is equally as impressive though I found myself worrying over how \\\"user friendly\\\" this beer is to the general public.  I was shocked to hear some mixed disapproval from my beer tasting comrades.  Apparently jalapeno beer is an acquired taste like black coffee, kombucha or moldy cheese.  But what I love most about this place, aside from their top notch craft beers brewed on site, is their exceptional customer service.  Coming from a hospitality background, my radar for these sorts of things is uncontainable and even on high alert and in search of any pinprick of poor performance or inattentiveness; in the 3 hours I spent at this establishment I experienced only perfection.  The staff is professional, knowledgeable, friendly and most importantly, in love with their beer.  Smack dab in the middle of Fremont Street in the notoriously lackluster yet rocketing Downtown district of fabulous Las Vegas, Banger Brewing doesn't scream out its arrival but proudly just says, \\\"Hey, Vegas.  Here I am.  I hope you like my beer.\\\"  This place welcomes you in with a smile, an ice cold glass and a great brew to fill it.  It's like walking in to your corner neighborhood bar only with way better beer and even better service."}
{"label":0,"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge.  We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros.  We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor.  We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner.  The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.  The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat.  We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks.  The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time.  There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant.  Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back."}

To make up for the lack of food they have nightly visits from different food trucks to serve up  some yummy food. I am pretty sure they also let you call for delivery as well.\\n\\nSo if you are looking to grab a beer without the hassle of the 8th Street location crowds or the trip to Scottsdale check out this little gem. They have all the beers four peaks has and right now even have some Pumpkin Porter that is exclusive to this location.\\n\\nThe location is a bit tricky to find but trust me it is there.

It's like a chocolate shake basically that's rich and tastes like it has frozen micro ice in it... the flavor is just that \\\"hot chocolate\\\"..... The mojito however.. OMG, yum! I'm not one to like greenery in my alcohol, but these were exceptional. The Cheesecake one is good if you like syrupy and sweet.

The worker took her order and immediately went to make her drinks without  even acknowleding me.. not even a \\\"I'll be right with you\\\". In addition, I also thought that you should take orders in batches and since I was right after her, I just assumed he could take my order also before going on to make it (just in case we had the same order so he could save time and make it double). \\nHowever, what really irritated me is that this guy took 15+min to make TWO smoothies.

We were asked, \\\"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?\\\" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was \\\"Would you like a glass of water?\\\" They didn't say, \\\"Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah..\\\" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!!

The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.\\n\\nOverall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about. My local neighborhood bars like Timbers or PTs can do better."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place is the very definition of an Ultra Lounge.\\n\\nThe place has enough room to make you feel unenclosed, yet isn't so big that you lose the person you were talking to when you go to get a drink for them.  The bartenders are very easy on the eyes and are also friendly.   This may not seem like anything out of the ordinary, until you visit other lounges.  You'll soon discover that in Vegas, many ultra lounges employ ultra bitches.\\n\\nThe only lackluster thing about Lure is the patio area.   It's just an outside area with a fountain....no view.  Disappointing in comparison to the outdoor area at Tryst in the same hotel.\\n\\nLike many clubs and bars in Vegas, Lure closes at 4am.  (That should be plenty of time to get your mack on!!!)"}
{"label":3,"text":"I've been to Fuzzy's Tacos quite a few times and I've consistently had a good experience.\\n\\nMy go-to favorite for this place is the Taco Plate. You get two tacos and two sides for $6.49 - enough for a decent meal. I've had the veggie tacos and the tempura shrimp tacos, both very good. The chips and salsa are a sizable quantity with no skimping on the salsa.\\n\\nThe burritos are alright, but I suggest to stick towards the tacos. The hot sauce is sufficiently hot. I've been stuck waiting a while for my meal a few times... maybe a suggestion, if anyone at Fuzzy's is watching this: If someone orders chips, maybe they can grab those first while waiting for the other meals to come out?\\n\\nAll in all, a good place to get a few tacos and chips. Lots of TVs so it's good for watching sports. I'd suggest giving it a shot with a couple of your buddies when you get a chance."}

{"label":2,"text":"I came to Da Emma on a Friday night around 6pm, right when they open for dinner service. I adore the architecture\/layout\/atmosphere with the heavy metal doors and the rustic feel of the ex-womens' prison. \\n\\nIf you look to your right upon entering the restaurant, you'll see boards filled with pictures of eminent celebrities, athletes, randoms posing with I guess, Da Emma. Knowing that Angelina Jolie, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson, George Clooney (to name a few) had also dined at Da Emma made the experience more memorable.\\n\\nWe were seated right away and brought a plate of bruschetta and the menu. The bruschetta was more like a salty olive oil-ed sponge, not impressed. Our server literally plopped the all-Italian menu in front of us and peaced out with no explanation, no translation (even thought my boyfriend is Italia, he struggled with some of the items). \\n\\nWe ended up ordering the leg of lamb ($35) and veal ($30?). You have a choice of sides: veggies (pickled potatoes, 2 slices of eggplant, 2 slices of zucchini) or rotini with tomato sauce. The main dishes were enormous. If you are on the fence when it comes to lamb, I suggest you steer away from it at Da Emma. It's way too big- I couldn't manage half of it. The veal was amazing though! \\n\\nAll in all, the food was alright. Nothing too exciting. Our server was slow, cold, and intimidating, which is exactly what Da Emma is like."}
{"label":4,"text":"I'm a fan and didn't even try their pizza.\\n\\nI've had Metro Pizza bookmarked, then I took it off, then I put it back on, then I finally tried them.  I was seeking this place out every since I read an ROTD on it from last November.  Never found the time and wasn't in the area to ever try them until now. \\n\\nLet's start with the restaurant itself.  It's bigger than I expected. One thing missing from most reviews is the size of this restaurant. I expected a small typical pizza joint with your checkered red\/white tablecloths and gaudy decorations all over. Boy was I totally moted!!  This restaurant is classy, spacious, clean, and well lit.  Because of what I experienced walking in, I assumed a pricey menu.  My first thoughts, sure glad Terri R. is paying for lunch this time. Then I reviewed the menu and was brought back down to earth.  Bang for your buck for sure! \\n\\nMetro Pizza has a large selection of pizza, stuffed pizza, salads, calzones, platters, dinners, and one type of soup (Minestrone).  I didn't want to feel too heavy for lunch, so I opted against pizza this time.  I'm not a huge pizza guy anymore anyways.  I chose their Chicken Parmesan Sub w\/Garlic Fries ($9.25).  This is served hot, melted cheese, and just the right amount of sauce on top of about 8 oz of breaded chicken breast.  Simply delicious, portions big, and the chicken breast tender.  I washed my parmesan sub down with their garlic fries and glass of water.  In about 10 minutes, my meal was devoured.  \\n\\nOne thing about Italian Restaurants, either there's too much sauce which sometimes sogs out your meal or there's not enough where you're wanting more.  At Metro, they had it just right, not too much, not too little, and definitely not too thick.  Since I'm a new fan of Metro's Parm Sub, I'm sure their pizzas are good too.  Service was great from start to finish. Our food was also prepared and served with little wait. \\n\\nVoted \\\"The Best of Las Vegas\\\" 7 years in a row!!!  They obviously don't need my review to keep their status, but they got my 5 stars anyway."}

The quality of the ice cream is very satisfactory, but it's hard enjoying it when poor customer service and speed of service are low. It was also disappointing to see them skimp on the amount of my ice cream despite having to wait an incredibly long time (not only because the huge Gilbert family in their Suburban in front of me took forever to order - which they did - but they argued at the drive thru attendant and spun out their tires as they left). For that, they only get two stars and my only visit back to them is if I'm the only person in the store."}
{"label":2,"text":"I came here last night with a friend.  We were originally planning to go to Piper's Pub in the South Side, but his car was unavailable, so he asked if we could go somewhere in Squirrel Hill or Oakland, and this is what we chose.\\n\\nWe each ordered one cone ($4.99 each)--I ordered the white pizza one, and he ordered the Mediterranean.  Staff was quite friendly and conversational, though kind of wishy-washy when my friend asked for a flavor recommendation.  Our cones took between 10-15 min. to cook, but we were the only people ordering at that time (6:30 on a Mon.).  When they came up, we were hoping to sit at one of the two tables outside, but each of the tables had a person sitting and loitering at it.  I found this slightly annoying since it was clear that neither of these people had bought anything, and tables (incl. outside ones) should be reserved for paying customers.  So we ended up sitting inside across from a table of noisy high school students.\\n\\nMy white pizza cone was filled with the toppings you'd expect on a white pizza: mozzarella, ricotta, and broccoli.  Though I'm a white pizza aficionado, I was underwhelmed by the flavor of my cone, which I found bland and insufficiently savory.  I think this was due to the ratio of cheese being off (too much ricotta).  Having said that, my cone was quite filling (I didn't regret not ordering a second), and was served at just the right temperature (hot but edible).  My friend enjoyed his Mediterranean cone, which he said contained quite a few olives, though it was served hotter than mine, so it was difficult for him to eat (even after he'd reached the middle after several minutes, it was still steaming).\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or an inexpensive meal, I'd recommend checking this place out.  Based on my review and others, there are some kinks the ownership needs to work out, but they have an interesting product.  I'd return, but I think I'd try another flavor next time, such as the pepperoni or Hawaiian.  3.5 stars."}

Now I have changed my review because they have continually disappointed me.  They never seem to get my eggs cooked the way I like them.  The corn beef hash use to be fresh and plentiful and now they are skimpy and dry.  The bacon (use to give 4 and now only 3?) my husband ordered was greasy and not crispy.  He likes his toast to be well toasted and they brought them out completely burnt.  It was sent back and all they did was scrape some of the burnt off the toast.  Our eggs were either underdone or overcooked.   They didn't even look appetizing.  The last time we were there the manager saw what was happening but didn't even come to our table to apologize.

{"label":0,"text":"Susie's estate sales is a big rip off. All of their stuff is extremely overpriced so they can tell their client that their stuff didn't sell, which forces the client to \\\"donate\\\" their stuff. Then, Susie's takes the stuff and sells it behind the client's back to make a profit. It's obvious that they are doing this since they don't seem to care about no one buying anything, even if it's the last day of the sale.The one bigger woman who works there is a complete snob about it too. You don't even want to negotiate with them because they are so rude. Oh! and don't say you love garage selling.

We had the following:\\n\\n**Jalapeno Poppers: Now these are legitimately awesome, and would get them on their own.  Great taste, not to spicy and a perfect sauce.  \\n\\n**Fries (Truffle Parmesan\/Sweet Potato\/Regular): These were all delicious, as was their accompanying sauces. \\n\\n**Hells Kitchen Burger: So shouldn't this be the main event?  I was anxiously awaiting some crazy taste bud exploding moment of ecstasy that never came.  The meat was bland, the cheese didn't have much of a taste and I never felt like I tasted the peppers.  I did get it medium, so I was surprised that it was so devoid of flavors.  What happened to this supposedly insane burger?\\n\\nService wasn't good.  After we ordered, the waiter mentioned that since the burgers taken 30-45 minutes to make, we might want to think about some appetizers.  Great, thanks for letting us know.  We ordered three (3) appetizers, and they came out about 25 minutes later.  3-4 minutes after that all our burgers came out.  So much for getting appetizers to hold us over for our meal. We all had suspicions that our tab was intentionally  raised, but whatever.  \\n\\nSince we had players cards, we had a small discount on the food, which amounted to about $20.  He forgot to apply it, and he said he would after he ran our credit\/debit cards.  He \\\"forgot\\\" yet again, until I explained to him that he had not ran our players card discount.  He did finally corrected it, but after I spotted it twice.  My party felt like he was doing way too many things on \\\"purpose\\\" to forget to apply the discount.  \\n\\nThe funny thing is that I did not want to say anything about my experience at BurGR with my friends since one of them really wanted us to go try it out.  It wasn't until we went to Fat Burger right before we were heading back home that two of my friends commented on how much better Fat Burger was than BurGR, at a fraction of the price.

(closer to Uno's and Connies than Giorgano's but we will take it). This could be because their other locations are all in Illinois. They also serve thin (sliced correctly, in squares), double crust, pan, and stuffed.  Upon being seated, the table receives (free) a basket of the most delightful garlic parmesan bread bites we have ever tasted.  These, plus a salad, would be enough for a normal person's dinner.  But no, get the pizza and take it home.  A medium deep dish will feed your house for the next few days, and warms up as delicious as first served.  Sadly, filling up on the bread and anticipating a pizza meal was not enough for us.  We also ordered the cheesy bacon fries.  We were overstuffed but not sorry.  These feature real bacon, two cheeses and dipping sauce.  We have never, ever, had fries this good.\\nThe restaurant is cute and comfortable with Italian country decor, but a bit small.  A large party with children came in when we were in mid meal and we were asked to move to a booth so they could push all the tables on one side of the room together. We did not mind moving, unfortunately the large party with children in the small space subjected us to learning much more about the lives and activities of them and their children than we ever wanted or needed to know. Size feels like a real restaurant in Italy without the outdoor seating.They provide linen napkins but no tablecloths.  The staff provided regular check-ins to see if we needed anything, refilled beverages without being asked and the food was served promptly. The server was extremely patient with an elderly foursome who did not understand their check or how to use an entertainment coupon (close quarters, we heard it all clearly).\\nIn summary, I would gladly chance the possibility of loud families in close quarters to feast on those delightful bread bites and the great pizza."}

The drinks consisted of water with apple slices and they had oranges and apples for snacks for the women, but my husband said he didn't have the fruit on his side. One of my services was a 25 min facial. Nothing specials, no extractions, just massage and cream.

It's really hit or miss.  The first time I got the Spinach 4-Cheese Quesadilla and it was just too greasy and cheesy.  I know, I know it's \\\"4-cheese\\\", but there is a delicate balance with cheese.  My friend ordered it another time and the balance was much better.  The second time I went I got the Veggie Rice Bowl.  Wonderful seasoning, but they overcooked the tofu.  We also ordered the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  No thanks.  My friend had the salmon - loved it.  My other friend got the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap separate times.  He liked both. The 3rd time I ordered the Veggie Bowl without the tofu (much better).  The falafel fries are yummy.  The tiramisu is absolutely INCREDIBLE!

This meal, to me, was the perfect blend of my favorite stuff: grilled boneless chicken kabob, perfectly seasoned rice and awesome salad. We even braved the terrible service of the girl who used to answer the phone (she was very rude) to come and get this food!\\n\\nHowever, at some point they decided to change things around. The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella. I love cheese but I loved feta in this setting more so the change was annoying to me. By far, though, the rice change realllllly got me. It got me so much that I stopped eating here.\\n\\nThen, I decided to give it another try. To my surprise, the rice was ALMOST back to what it used to be. I was temporarily happy again!! Until, several weeks later, another craving hit and I went back to get takeout and I was given the type of rice that I hate. This ruined the entire meal for me. I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.\\n\\nIn any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him.

The bartended approached us pretty quickly but after that it went down hill.  Sat there with empty glasses a couple of times and just luckily caught the bartenders eye to wave him down to our end of the bar.  He seemed more interested in working the service bar.  So we started out with crab cakes and lettuce wraps. Crab cakes were terrible.  Had no taste what so ever.  The frozen ones I bought at BJ's were definately better.  The chicken wraps had some flavor but still nothing exciting.  My friend got the scallops which he said were good and I got the Miso Cod with peaches and fried rice.  Peaches were disgusting. Tasted like canned peaches that had been soaking for several hours in some marinade. The fish was okay I guess, but it was just cod.  Like I said, I think the main reason Zink might continue to exist is only because of people not wanting to wait hours to eat at Cowfish."}

It was enough to cool off the room - but it still felt a tad on the humid side. Again, another really old hotel with an inefficient, antiquated central AC system. Given the nature of this building, I doubt they could ever retrofit the building with the necessary HVAC infrastructure to improve it. I could be wrong.\\n\\nOne plus over the last time I stayed here is that the old analog style, CRT-based TVs are now gone - at the least in the room I stayed in had a newer flat panel HD TV set.\\n\\nAs before in my previous review:\\n\\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late.  We attempted to visit both the above 7-11 and CVS - but it was after 10:00 pm and three years later they ar still keeping the same limited hours.\\n\\nAnd you can't get any food at the Braddock Bar in the Hotel lobby after 10:00 pm or so.

We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \\\"jelly\\\" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.

I figured since they advertise how high the calories are- that this was going to be the best burger and chili cheese fries I've ever had.  NOT THE CASE!  I came with a big group of people and we all ordered different things, to give the menu a try.  When I got my food, the burger and chili cheese fries were dripping in grease.  The fries had a grease pool formed around them and the chili looked like ground up dog food.  The worst part- the burger and the fries tasted bland!  You would think with that much grease that it would have SOME flavor.  Everyone in our party threw away most of their food.   I will never eat here again.

{"label":1,"text":"I am going to start off by just stating that this place is hit-or-miss.  I've been here before for events and had a great time.  Everyone loves the cocktails and the bartender KNOWS his tequilas.  I've never really sat down for serious eating here until two days ago.  I waited 48 hours to write this and I still can't shake feeling ripped off.  \\n\\nI generally shrug off service issues.  La Comida is a hip place in a currently hip part of town.  I'm not there for Zagat rated service.  But in a restaurant a quarter full, we shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a server. This set the stage. We asked about any specials, but the server told us they are listed on the menu. I then pointed out those were SPECIALTIES, do they have any daily specials? I then told him in Spanish. He got it, laughed and said no.  Pretty matter of fact, but on top of a ten minute wait, not appreciated.\\n \\nI ordered the shrimp ceviche. My date the chicken burrito.  My \\\"dinner\\\" came back a little cup of miniature shrimp, no bigger than a dime, on top of some diced fruits and avocado. It looked and tasted like half of the serving you get in a 99 cent shrimp cocktail in sundae glass up the block the California Hotel on Fremont Street.  Worse? It tasted like it! I couldn't believe it. The way it was described by the waiter, it seemed it would at least be in league with similar restaurants.  This couldn't even hold a candle to Applebee's.  This dish was $12 and it couldn't have cost them more than a quarter to make.  I was livid, but on a date, so just smiled....and drank my warm Modelo.\\n\\nMy date fared better. The chicken burrito had a chewy tortilla wrap, but the chicken was good and somewhat ample.  It was also kind of pricy at 12 bucks, but could tolerate it because was more than a cup of miniature brine shrimp at the same price. My date's Modelo was also warm (but we were told they were supposed to be like that by the waiter. OLE')\\n\\nBottom line...this is a destination restaurant more for taking selfies with drinks in hand than actually eating food.  I don't think the owners, Jenna and Michael Morton, who are renowned for creating dining experiences, are probably even privy to this kind of spotty food and service going on.  I'm hoping they are not.  But if it's really good food you want for the money, I'd say have a drink here first and move on."}

We got our tickets and went through the concession walk through\/ self serve, which I honestly think is just silly, why can't they just have the regular concession counter like at the other theaters? The reason I don't like the self serve is because everything is always messy and sticky, which it was! People just let there kids who are too small to reach the soda fountain help themselves to whatever they want and they get soda everywhere! I don't mean to sound like a hard ass, but watch your kids people!!! So of course it doesn't get wiped up in a timely manner and thus everything in that walk thru is pretty gross! \\n\\nMy family enters the theater and you know the build up when you walk in and you wonder how many people are already in there and you wonder if you will get to pick any seat you want or if it will be full already and you will have to sit next to strangers........ you know what I am talking about. \\nSo we walk down the corridor and round the corner, yay my kids get to pick whatever seats they want, blah blah blah..... I can't be excited for them because all I can see is garbage! Yes I said garbage! There was garbage, popcorn, candy boxes, soda cups, under all the seats! I had to turn around and make sure we didn't walk into a movie that was already playing! But in fact we were in the correct theater and that was in fact trash under all the seats! So apparently they don't actually sweep out the trash, instead they just sweep it under the seats?!?! I was freaking out, but I had to do my best to put my OCD away so I didn't ruin the night for my kids. My hubby didn't even have to look at me to know what was going on, he did his best to find the seats with the least trash. \\nThen once the movie started we noticed there was a big scratch down the left side of the movie screen!

The outfits are very enjoyable for us guys.  No complaints there.  The late night menu does not have everything I had seen on the normal menu.  However they do have a late night deal with a cheeseburger, fries, and soda for 9.99.  My wife got that, I opted for the double cheeseburger with bacon, carmelized onions, and russian dressing which I got on the side.  They asked if you want it medium or well.  I chose medium.  It came quickly and it was unbelievable.  Im happy to see their medium is medium rare like I love.  This burger tasted so good that I feel like Marshall on How I Met Your Mother where he dreams of that one burger place that he went to and he can't remember where it was, but he knows how amazing it was.  That's how I feel about this burger.  I miss it so much, and I've been thinking about it for days since I got back and I wish it was here with me right now.  Luckily unlike Marshall I know where to go to get that burger.  The burger was so juicy, it was covered in bacon.  I've never seen so much bacon on a burger.  And the fries were fresh cut and outstanding.  Im not even a big fry fan but these were tasty.  I highly endorse this place.

{"label":3,"text":"My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.  I think it helped make the wedding reception more pleasurable as we had already had an opportunity to meet.  Angela made it so easy to arrange."}

{"label":2,"text":"Went here last night for dinner around 8pm. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated promptly. There was a pizza and wine special (every Weds apparently), but we opted to go order from the menu as i had pizza for lunch.  I love trying chicken salad sandwiches at new places, so why should this place be any different? Maizie's had grapes and dried apricots mixed in... Wonderful! Perfectly peppery to balance out the fruit.  For the side, the server recommended a mix of hand-cut and sweet potato fries, which did not disappoint.  I love SP fries that are medium cut like theirs and the fresh-cut potatoes were amazing! The chipotle aioli was quite good too.  I wasn't in the mood for a drink (what?!), but i did try the bf's red sangria, which was pretty good and i would definitely order it next time i want a cocktail.  He ordered the special which was ribs with sides of new potatoes, roasted veggies and some sort of corn. He couldn't finish it all and that is quite odd for him. At $13 it was quite the steal for him to have leftovers!\\nI hope we can get back there for happy hour, which runs from 3-6pm... I can't remember if its weekdays or every day... But i look forward to a few $3 sangrias!   =)"}
{"label":1,"text":"The wait after you order is pretty bad. It took over an hour to get out main course at lunch. Big waste of time. Can't say it's like this for everyone since even people who came later than us got their food earlier so I think it's just hit or miss based on disorganization. The food is OK. I wouldn't come here just for the food though. The only shining light to this experience is that they served us foie gras when it's not available for lunch. But it is available for dinner, so why not just make it available at all times instead of making people ask for it?"}

{"label":3,"text":"I just indulged myself with Dinner for the first time at Verrado Grille last night, and I must say that it was a great experience under the circumstances. \\n\\nThey close at 9 pm and we got there at about 8:30, so I was expecting poor service because of our timing. Our waitress was nice, and the service was still good for being almost closing time. \\n\\nI had a pint of Verrado Ale (which is 8th street from Four Peaks) and ordered the Almond Encrusted Basa, which was a beautifully cooked white fish with this delicious Orzo\/Risotto side. \\n\\nThe price is right about ball park for the level of quality you get, I would even pay up a little more for it. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience and I would recommend that you aim for a sunset dinner, as the view over the golf coarse and the white tank mountains is amazing during that time."}
{"label":0,"text":"Very poor service.  I ordered several books online and requested all new.  They shipped me two of them used.  When I contacted them, they said they do that if no new ones are available - without even confirming with the customer.  When I said that I wanted new, as I requested, they said I would have to bring the book in and order it again.  I reminded them that I paid for shipping so I wouldn't have to go down to pick them up.  They did not care.  They pretty much said that I would have to do the leg work to correct THEIR mistake.  No concept at all of what good customer service is."}

{"label":0,"text":"This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \\n\\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \\n\\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \\\"testing\\\" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \\\"Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\\\"  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \\n\\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \\\"loosening up nicely\\\" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \\n\\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \\\"drink lots of water\\\" and I thought to myself, \\\"For what?\\\"  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \\n\\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."}

{"label":2,"text":"The search for great coffee close to home continues....\\n\\nStopped here on a Saturday morning. The lot was empty so we were a little scared they weren't open, but the hours on the door said otherwise. We went inside and there was one other patron finishing up breakfast and one barista training another. The staff was friendly and patient while we looked over the menu.\\n\\nI ordered a medium pumpkin spice iced coffee that they had advertised. My husband ordered a large one shot dirty chai. The total came to just over $11. When we received our drinks, mine was incorrect and the barista was happy to make another. \\n\\nAs we walked out i commented to my husband on the price. Mine was $4.95...not really sure why, and I'm still left wondering. Flavored beans, I guess. The regular iced coffee price is $3.10....that's $1.85 difference. Not worth it. Although I was happy with what I received, if I return it will be for just a plain ol' iced coffee."}
{"label":3,"text":"You know you're Vegas spoiled when you give the Wynn Buffet 4 stars.  I've been to the Rio, Bellagio, and M buffets in recent history.  The Wynn is 2nd best to Bellagio and I'll explain why...\\n\\nPrice? EXCELLENT.  I came here on Friday before 3:30pm to get a weekday lunch price of $24.  The dinner food rolled in shortly afterwards.\\n\\nFood?  HITS AND MISSES.  \\n- Duh, go for the prime rib.\\n- Vegetarian options are generous and pleasing!  They have curries and Indian naan.\\n-  The items in the bamboo steamers are delicious, but watch out because the steam will sting your hand!\\n- The crab legs could definitely be more fresh.  At Bellagio buffet, the seafood was sweet, a sign of freshness. Here, not so much.\\n- DO NOT get the made-to-order pasta unless you like to drink olive oil.  The chefs go insane with the oil, adding enough to create a thick layer beneath your pasta.  Disgusting and unappetizing.\\n- The dessert selections looked beautiful, but the items I tried did not live up to their visual appeal.  I preferred the GELATO (could not stop getting this.  they come in the cutest tea cups) and the denser cakes (chocolate based).  The jello\/champagne like shooters were icky tasting.  \\n\\nMy buffet experience here was rated against higher standards, but just keep this in mind:  avoid that pasta or it will kill you.  The price is definitely more affordable than the buffet at Bellagio with a nearly comparable selection of quality food."}

{"label":0,"text":"After discussing lunch plans and deciding that we were  long overdue for some Mexican food my girlfriend and I decided to give Cantina 1511 a try.  For starters, the hostess sat us in a relatively unoccupied section and then sat subsequent patrons right next to us.  Although we were seated before the party next to us they got waited on first.  A few minutes later, Tim, our waiter materializes to taken our order.  Tim did take the time to help us navigate the menu and pointed out the main categories which was helpful.  After careful consideration, I ordered the two tacos - a carnes asada and whatever the duck one is called.  My girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas Verde.  Interestingly enough,  the fresh-made-to-order food came out not even 10 minutes after we ordered.  We barely had time to enjoy the greasy and over-salted chips that tasted of old cooking oil and salsa that tasted slightly worse than Old El Paso.  My girlfriend's entree arrives on a skillet with a pile of something under a pool of runny cheese and a another plate with two pitiful looking soft tacos (my entree).  We had both ordered black beans which were void of any real flavor and a complete disappointment (don't get me started on the Charro beans).  A minute or two into digging into her meal, my girlfriend realizes that there's chicken in her enchiladas.  We soon figured out she had been given the wrong entree.  Despite the mistake, the entree tasted like something you might get at a Senior's Center on Mexican food night. Thankfully she is no longer vegetarian.  We quickly flagged down the waiter and explained the mistake.  He said he would check with the kitchen but then showed up a few minutes later with our check.  Needless to say, we'll not be giving this place a second chance."}

{"label":1,"text":"I'm weary from traveling to an overrated Madison destination.\\n\\nI had heard of Weary Traveler through Yelp and wanted to go to a cool hangout for my birthday since a few friends were in town.  I don't get to Willy St. very often so I figured it was a good reason to try a fun spot.  I have to say, I was unimpressed.  \\n\\nWe were traveling in a group of seven, and we showed up after 8pm on a Saturday.  I fully was expecting a crowded scene and it lived up to expectations.  Unfortunately, two six-person groups had arrived just before us so we were in for an hour wait.  Not the most terrible thing in the world because it was a chance to drink and catch up with each other at the bar.  Good selection of beer and the service was attentive, as long as you don't mind being served by a rude bartender.  Granted, it was busy, but we were quite pleasant to her and she still threw our change back without so much as a 'thank you.'  \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated at a nice corner circular booth, we did have a good waitress who was very cool.  I ordered Bob's Bad Breath Burger, which was pretty tasty, though while it said 'grass-fed,' it did seem like the patty was the pre-made frozen kind.  I wasn't overly blown away.  My friend's ordered the Carne Asada that looked ok, if you like a few cut pieces of steak over a bed of tortilla chips with some pico de gallo.  Again, didn't really blow my socks off.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, it's LOUD.  They certainly pack a lot of tables into the two sides of the restaurant and waiters and waitresses are always squeezing behind you at the bar and between the close tables.  The old-school decor, however, is dark, warm and inviting, which I thought was a plus.\\n\\nMake no mistake:  Weary Traveler is a place to be seen.  The locale on the Willy St. corner is great and there is a reason it is so busy.  The prices seemed reasonable, though I don't think I'll be itching to go back anytime soon."}

We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8 which is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open. It had gone bad. We asked to change it out for Alaskan Amber. That had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away, which I don't do. The pizza was not square as they boast but round. And it looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on their website. Small and scarce pepperoni with a cracker thin crust. Tasted like the pizza you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is it was frozen.

And yes, the donuts were good. \\n\\nIts tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\\n\\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\\n\\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed.

I was gambling at the Stratosphere so I decided to stop here to give their pina coladas a try.  \\n\\nThere were two bartenders on duty. One older guy and one younger guy. Both were horrible! First of all, they were totally uninterested in the bar and its customers. They seemed to only be interested in each other and huddling up to talk to each other on the other side of the bar where nobody was sitting.\\n\\nPeople, such as myself, would come up to order a drink and they never checked on customers or anything. I stood there for close to 10 minutes before this guy who had been at the bar with his girlfriend for a while drinking and playing games, whistled to get the younger guy's attention to come serve me.\\n\\nHe finally comes over there and walked over to them and said, \\\"What do you need?\\\" They said, \\\"Dude we don't need anything, but you have a customer that has been standing here for the longest time waiting to be served.\\\" So he looked over at me and hesitantly walked up. He still didn't say anything. He didn't greet me or say, \\\"Can I get you something?\\\" NOTHING! He just stood there with this blank look on his face like he couldn't IMAGINE what I might want from him??!!\\n\\nSo I said, \\\"Um, I would like to order drinks\\\". And he said, \\\"Oh...drinks?\\\" AS IF this was news to him that someone would come up to a damn bar to order DRINKS??!!  So I ordered my drinks for myself and the person I was with. So he made the drinks and never ONCE made eye contact or exerted any sort of true customer service. He just rang me up.\\n\\nThe damn pina colada was $9.75 and it was below mediocre. argh  I went ahead and tipped him because if I didn't, I know his lame ass would have probably blamed it on me being black and NOT on the fact that he's a lousy bartender that gave shitty, dismissive service!\\n\\nOn top of that, while I was standing there waiting for my drinks to be made, the older guy argued with this couple about the amount they charged them for their drinks. They were arguing that because they were playing video poker (or whatever game it was up there) that they shouldn't be charged full price for their drinks. They were saying that they were staying at the hotel and the night before they paid less than $9 for the same drinks BECAUSE they were playing video poker. But on that day, this older guy was charging them $12 for their drinks.\\n\\nThe older guy was very gruff in his tone when telling them there was NO WAY they could have paid anything below $9.75 for their drinks. So he was basically calling them liars. When they tried to appeal to the younger guy, he was confused as hell. In one breath he was telling them they charge less if you're playing games at the bar...and in the next breath he was telling them they had to pay full price for their drinks? They were pissed.\\n\\nAnyway, the bartender that I had to deal with was named Ben. Steer clear of his clueless, non customer service having ass! I don't know what their deal was that day but they pissed me off. All I wanted was a pina colada and instead I was treated like I was a nuisance to them! So weird!"}

Although they told me it would be done on Monday, they called at 2:30 to say it was ready to go!\\n\\nWhen I picked up the bike, they told me that I didn't need the heavy duty tubes or slime due to the type of tire I had chosen.

{"label":2,"text":"This is a great place to buy makeup or skincare, I love that they have pretty much everything (except Laura Mercier?)- \\nAs far as the salon goes, I've had different experiences here.  One senior stylist did a great job on a cut ( I think she was the director), another senior stylist did an OK job, and I've had some bad cuts as well, when I left feeling like I didn't get what I paid for.  I had great highlights a few times there (senior stylist), and both times I really stressed how much I liked that they didn't turn out brassy, but nobody bothered to write down what they used on my card.   When I went back for the third time to get highlights, the (Jr. Stylist) girl just used whatever they had, it turned out brassy. I knew I was in trouble when she said \\\"we'll just use a toner.\\\" For some reason, that never helps (I think because my hair is so naturally dark, and they need to use a blue-based bleach and\/or leave it on longer to process). Really, it's not my business to know that much detail, it's theirs, but I've been in self-protection mode lately, trying to figure out what went wrong so it won't happen again. This salon can also get a bit gossipy and is less professional than some others, and I never felt \\\"pampered\\\" in the salon.  If you choose to give this place a try, I would recommend paying more and going with a senior stylist. I did notice another reviewer who loved this place, and her hair looks great in the pic, so I think it just depends on who you get.  Like I said though, it's a great place to buy cosmetics."}

My wife's burger was great and way better than my burger. It has some sort of tempura on the burger with loads of sweet chili and was delicious.

We were greeted by our waitress who was not only beautiful but sweet.  She was very accommodating and attentive.  She quickly brought over freshly squeezed orange juice, (none of that fake bar OJ we have in Hawaii) cranberry juice and cans and cans of Red Bull.  She made each of our drinks and left us to party.  We had our own personal buss boy who was just as attentive.  With just a drip of condensation on the ground and he was there to clean it up.

However, my same complaint as before - I saw avocado on the ingredients list and I was over-joyed with happiness - BUT the burrito was somewhat lacking in my expectation of avocado goodness. Perhaps I have learned my lesson and will order EXTRA avocado from here on out. The burrito also came with little potatoes and ketchup to dip them in. I only had a few, because the burrito was very large, in fact - I didn't finish it!\\n\\nRachel's Kitchen is great for an outdoor brunch. I do like it, but again it is in The District and if you can deal with a little bit of the snooty customers who inhabit this particular shopping center, than you will be fine.

I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4\/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.\\n\\nRestaurants\/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.\\n\\nPool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?\\n\\nNightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40\/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy \\\"del toro\\\" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40\/40. boo\\n\\nEase of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.\\n\\nOverall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail.

From what I remember as a child I loved the pizza here! We came on a weekday for dinner, felt weird cause 2 adults, hahah whatever no shame.  We got a pizza and the wings, both were sooo good! The games are pretty old because I remember playing them as a child.. can't really comment on anything else except they have REALLY SLOW SERVICE.  It took 10 mins for someone to come to the front.  After dinner we relived our childhood days by playing the games, full and happy.  We'd probably come again for the pizza and wings"}
{"label":2,"text":"Well... It was dead. The waitress and the chef were sitting in the dark dining area and just talking to each other when we walked in. It was my husbands idea that we should try \\\"my kind\\\" of food, since I'm from the Balkans and we have some similarities with the Russians (Russian\/Ukranians own the place). So we got in and the waitress welcomed us and turned on the TV, lots of Turkish music for some reason... Oh and those lights that you find in a club, it was really awful for that peaceful atmosphere.\\n\\nThe waitress was really nice and polite, we didn't needed any explanation with the menu since it was nicely explained and plus I understand most of the language. I ordered the Potato Variniki (basically boiled ravioli with potato stuffing) and they were half empty, guessed they leaked out. But the ones we did get, they were pretty bland but nothing s&p won't fix. Also my side salad for the entree got first to our table, before the app. Our fries (which were also sides to our entrees) also arrived before the main dish. I had the Shish Kabob, chopped pieces of lamb on a giant skewer, which was ridiculouslly huge and looked dangerous, It tasted pretty okay, I got 10 pieces total and it was $15.99... The husband had a lamb sandwich, which was loaded with the same lamb meat, tomatoes, lettuce and lots of tzatziki and it was only $4.99... So I guess I screwed up there :D oh and they too...\\n\\nIced tea with no ice... Which meant freshly brewed and not cooled and then poured over the ice. \\n\\nThey do have delivery in the near area, so I guess we'll order next time. ;)"}

{"label":2,"text":"The flavor is still ridiculously good, the atmosphere is better with the high ceiling and well lit space, but the crawfish are not worth the money. The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.\\n\\nAt Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers. \\n\\nThe service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal. I am still more fond of the original location, but this one is rather attractive."}
{"label":2,"text":"Relative to Cirque's \\\"O\\\" and Dragone's \\\"Le Reve\\\" this is not a five star show. That being said, this was a very visually beautiful and entertaining show in its own right. Mystere had its residence at the Treasure Island since 1993 and not a shortage of fans throughout the years, despite there being six other Cirque shows on the strip. As most of the other Cirque shows, Mystere combines a mixture of circus skills, dance, opera, music, and comedy. The awe-inspiring performance features a story that attempts to integrate human actors into a seamless whole to capture the complexity that we call life. The story itself is difficult to explain as it intertwines a magical word, exotic creatures and the world as we know it. In short, Mystere is a celebration of life.\\n\\nI did not like that the theater did not have a restroom and you had to venture into the casino to use the restroom. Also, no outside alcohol allowed, but you are free to buy a cup of wine for $9!\\n\\nWe had amazing seats, and I was not observant enough to recognize the layout of the theater and if there really were any \\\"bad\\\" seats in the theater."}

I had a two hour layover at McCarran on a Saturday morning right after CES. The thing about this airport is it's freaking tiny...I mean it's huge but really the ceilings are soooo low and there's hardly any seating so most people are sprawled along the hallways. There are slot machines around every corner which you think might be kind of fun until you realize they're shitty machines and most people sitting at them are asleep because there is no where else to sit! In fact most people in the place were either hung over, drunk or asleep. Again to be expected in Vegas. Also in my particular case the airplane was in the air for 40 minutes between Vegas and LA and the stop over was completely pointless really. I will never make that mistake again."}

{"label":0,"text":"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\\n\\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\\n\\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\\n\\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\\n\\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\\n\\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\\n\\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\\n\\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\\n\\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \\\"retouched photos\\\" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\\n\\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job."}

I was starving by the time we got there because it took much longer to find it than I anticipated. Chandler Blvd goes very far west. I was also overdressed (loungy you are not Babaloos). The restaurant itself is in a strip mall (albeit a slightly fancier strip mall than one on Thomas Rd. in Central Phoenix but a strip mall nonetheless). The service was slow; I guess those Grupon's really threw them off their game. We ordered a salad and an appetizer (both unappetizing and unforgettable), I was ready to throw in the towel and then the entrees came.\\n\\nWe ordered Berenjena con Sofrito (eggplant with sofrito) and Jicama a la Parilla (grilled jicama) which both came with platanos (the eggplant with tostones and the jicama with platano frito). We had to order another side of the platano fritos because they were that good. The eggplant was so packed with flavor, I didn't want my meal to end. The jicama made for a light entree, but sufficient for my partner. While the entrees were phenomenal, I'm not sure I'd make a trip back, given the distance and the high prices. I may just stick with Havana Cafe."}

{"label":3,"text":"You wanna' talk \\\"all you can eat Brasilian BBQ?\\\"...... Here's my qualifier.\\n\\nOur family, on my wife's side, is Brasilian. (In Brazil, it's spelled with an \\\"s\\\"). Over the last 30 years or so, I've eaten at the most complete churracarias both in Brasil and here. And I've eaten at the most modest; including a churracaria in a gas station in Sul de Minas on the way to visit a coffee cooperative. (see my youtube video titled, \\\"Coffee Cupping in Sul de Minas.\\\") The defining\/qualifying points are the same; quality and flavor of the meat, completeness of the salad bar, or \\\"bars\\\", (Some restaurants have a full sushi bar, with chef!), and quality of service. . So trying to remain both objective and relevant, I'll share my opinion.\\n\\nI've been to the Fogos in Dallas, Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas. My best experience was in Dallas, but understanding that I was there right after their opening, and because Fogo corporate is in Dallas, I think they worked at \\\"doing it all\\\". This was probably before they reviewed and revised their operations. (?) Dallas was the best. Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas, were both a disappointment, but more because they do not reflect the best of what I expect in a \\\"high end\\\" churrascaria. And I personally think they're making a mistake. Here's what most non-Brasilians are missing....... but wouldn't know it if they've never been to a more \\\"typical\\\" churrascaria in Brasil.\\n\\nThe salad bar.... In Brasil, and at churrascarias like Fogo in Sao Paulo, Rio, and the interior cities like Brasilia, Goiania and Uberlandia, there will be everything you see at Fogo in LV, plus another full bar of hot entrees, including fish and meat dishes, stroganoff, hot vegetables, rice and black beans. And yes, the fried plantans too. All this is available at the bar, all you can eat, not brought to your table like at Fogo. You'll also see that \\\"cheese bread\\\" called \\\"pao de queiju.\\\" In some restaurants, there'll be either a small, or very expanded sushi bar. The salad bar, by itself, can easily support anyone's craving for a full meal. Fogo's salad bar is amazingly small, in my opinion, and for Brasililans, incomplete... especially for the money! Fogo offers the \\\"salad bar only\\\" for under $30... but in my opinion, it's not worth it. If they had a traditionally full salad bar offering, it would be great for non-red meat eaters, as there would be a huge variety of fish, shrimp, etc. \\n\\nThe meats... Here, Fogo does well, as the quality of the meats is very good. While some churrascarias buy low end meats, my feeling is that what Fogo doesn't offer in the salad bar, they make up for in the meat department.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT... If you want rare, medium rare, well done, etc., you should tell both the table waiter, and the meat servers! I will sometimes tell the servers that I only want the Picanha (tri-tip), the Filet, and the Fraudinha (flank steak). You're paying... tell them what you want, and how you like it! They appreciate your specifics, and even at this Fogo, I got what I wanted in meats.\\n\\nThe service... For a high-end churrascaria, it was ill-timed meat delivery, and it was slow. And when the gauchos (meat servers) did start coming to the table, it was an \\\"onslaught.\\\" The mark of a great churrascaria is \\\"consistency\\\" with an even rhythm. We spoke to our waiter, assigned to manage our table, and I could see that he was struggling to maintain service level to us, and other tables. That issue alone... erradic service, would be a major complaint point. And for this Fogo, all I could think of was....... this would never fly in Sao Paulo, or Rio, or at any other of their Brasilian locations. \\n\\nA major deal breaker for Brasilians, and what told me this operation was tailored to \\\"Non-Brasilians\\\", was the fact that they serve rice and black beans only after being asked. Had I not asked, our table may have been overlooked. That's rediculous, as the foundation for a plate in Brasil is your rice, black beans, vinegrette salsa, and farofa, or toasted corn meal that tops off the beans rice and salsa. When you have to ask for those very basic items, you know that Fogo has tailored, or \\\"dumbed down\\\" their restaurant to non Brasilians. And frankly, most people love these items after being introduced, and shown how to \\\"build their plate.\\\"\\n\\nSo I gave Fogo a 4-star just because they do serve great quality meat. And knowing ignorance is bliss, I figure that if what they do serve is good, and the clientel like it. who am I to complain because they don't mimic my preferred style of service. (although....... I do think you deserve better than what they offer at their salad bar setup.)\\n\\nBTW..... for a more traditional salad bar, and certainly more complete, visit Texas de Brazil at the Town Square Shopping Center, off South Las Vegas Blvd. I think you'll better understand my comments about the salad bar, and maybe agree that the trade-off at Texas de Brazil may be in the quality of the meat."}

Maybe it was the sitting-outside-and-actually-being-outside that made the experience so enjoyable... but no, I really think it was the fresh, hot sandwiches that made it such a memorable lunch spot.  It's too bad Vegas has Vegas-ized it into mediocrity.\\n\\nThe line was to the door at 4pm on a Saturday.  I was surprised, but I guess I shouldn't be - I forgot how time means nothing when you're in a casino.  Considering the sandwiches were pre-made and just needed to be plopped onto the panini-griller, it seemed to take a while - but I wasn't in a hurry, so I can deal.  \\n\\nI ordered the ham\/cheddar\/apple on pumpernickel and got it to go.  I was so excited to savor the awesomeness remembered from Bryant Park that I ripped it open in the car to take a few bites.  \\n\\nOooh, messy!  I don't know what happened - maybe the water content of the apples was too much? - but half of the sandwich was so soggy, it was like it had just been bathed.  The other half was just fine - so strange.  I think cheddar was the wrong cheese choice on their part - it made the whole thing so bland, like it zapped out any flavor the apples and ham had brought to the table.  I hate to say it, but I've had a Subway sandwich or two more exciting than this.  Maybe their other creations are better?"}

Watched the guy walk in back after actually making eye contact. Horrible service. Maybe they should stick to contractors and stop pretending they like to help the general public.

I have had the Southern Fried chicken salad and the Blackened Chicken Salad, both were good.  The avacado on Blackened Chicken salad was too ripe (brown spots and stuff) - it was a little weird.  But my friend had the special last week and it was fantastic and cheap.  It was $7.95 for a fantastic chicken breast over unreal 'smashed potatoes'.  My friend Tuesday got the wrap special which he said was excellent but in the description the waitress neglected to tell him there was bacon on the wrap and he is Muslim so we had to pick it out but other than that he said it was awesome.

After opening the box and devouring it's hot, fresh, yummy goodness, I was amazed at the fabulousness that is Marco's Pizza!!!  Ever since, the order is always right, the pizza hot and delicious, and the delivery speedy!  The parmesan crust is amazing!

This place houses 3 restaurants (347 Grill, Luxe and Cones Caf\\u00e9) The 347 Grill and the Luxe share the same kitchen, so you'll get the same food quality. The biggest difference between the two is the 347 Grill is family friendly and the Luxe is for adults only with more emphasis on the drinks as the bar anchors this lounge\/restaurant. My group ate at the Luxe due to the wait at Grill 347; the food was okay nothing to scream about good enough to keep the night festive, the price points were dead on. I had the Mediterranean salad which was well balanced and good in size however I wish the cucumbers were more freshly cut.

Already being a big fan of Phoenecia, I was a little hesitant at first to try Haji Baba, but I had a feeling that I would like it so I gave it a shot. There are three things that you absolutely have to try, and they are:\\n\\nThe falafel sandwich.\\n\\nThe gyro plate.\\n\\nThe dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).\\n\\nLike most of the reviews read, the falafels are some of the best around! They don't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor...not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap! As for the gyro plate, I have one thing to say...BEST GYRO MEAT IN PHOENIX! There, I said it. The meat is seriously succulent (you hear that about steak, not gyro meat!), no exaggeration. Just think of the best gyro meat you've ever tasted, but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around. Remember to get the plate when you go and I don't think you will regret it. And lastly, try the dolmas. I say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that I've been to, and that is warm. Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.  Get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance (not to be confused with the pee pee dance...taste buds don't pee).\\n\\nThere you have it!

Location - 4 star - Near to St. Thomas More on Wigwam and Pecos. usually no parking issues, but no shaded trees to park under.  Boo Hoo when it is over 100.  you come here to cool off and then you heat back up!\\n\\nc.  Ambiance - 4 star - The place is a long rectangle, which is great for long lines. However it is not inviting at all for sitting and eating inside. Just a bit \\\"cold\\\" or lacking character.\\n\\nIf you love ice cream and want a treat this  is the place to go!\\n\\nIF you want an even more unique experience, and want a crepe with your ice cream, drive a few miles south to Crepe Shack and Waffle on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the KMart Sears area.  This is a great place for Thrifty ice cream in a crepe with fruit.  Totally Yummy."}

{"label":0,"text":"I attended a birthday brunch on Sunday.  It's been a year since I had been and honestly I think 1 star is being generous at this point.  I would say the food is at a 4 now and that is because they dropped the popular desserts off the menu and only have the cotton candy.  Gone is the junk food dessert platter.  They still have items on the buffet portion but none really stood out to me.\\n\\nThe ribs and the apple cinnamon pancakes off the menu were amazing just like last year. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the horrid service we received.  So bad that we asked to speak to a manager when the bill came.  I understand we were a large party and so gratuity was already added which I guess to our main waiter, Kenny, meant that he didn't have to earn it.  Orders were slow, drinks were slow, utensils were slow.  Someone in our party waited 20 minutes for a fork.  Toward the end one of the birthday host found the alcohol and took over serving duties.  It was deja vu from last year.  \\n\\nManagers excuse was they were short staffed.  I don't want to hear excuses.  Kenny should have mentioned that when we first seated.  He could have left pitchers of water, tea, extra utensils on the table to alleviate his burden.  Last year the server left the champagne bucket and we served ourselves.  \\n\\nFINAL WARNING:  PAY WITH CASH or Simons will hijack your bank account.  It has now been four days and they still have a hold on my account for a bottomless brunch I didn't order for $77.  It's not necessarily the amount but the principle.  I was also charged $51 for the alcohol free brunch which is what was my bill should have been.   I called and talked to the manager and he said it happens pretty frequently.  I understand holds but charging me for an entire meal I didn't order is out of line.  Again, just excuses."}

I was checked in to two rooms both with disgusting dirty bathtubs. Told that it was unable to be cleaned and given 4 cookies. I got in my car, drove 4 minutes to a CVS for $3.98 I purchased a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and in 10 minutes in front of a staff member, after having driven 8 hours, I cleaned my own hotel bathroom. Unbelievable. Unbelievably embarrassed for this brand. Hyatt Place is my hotel of choice for business and personal trips and I choose this brand above all else. But having to clean my own bathroom that in addition to being covered with grime and dirt also had human hair is just beyond any bad experience I've ever had.

We pointed it out,, and she tried to tell us that we did not order a bottle. Well, we all heard it, and she was wrong. She relented, and said she would go get it, and tried to take the glass away. We all know it was going in the trash - so when we told her not to take it away and she said she'd add the glass to our check, we all looked at each other, then her, and asked her to leave it. She agreed, and said she would have to charge us for it. I was flabbergasted. Ultimately her coworker witnessed the event and took it off for us.\\n\\nThe entire evening went like that. It was like she couldn't agree with us on anything. She closed out the evening without disappointing our expectation of more poor service and argumentative behavior.\\n\\nWe asked for dessert menus. She told my wife that the bread pudding was amazing, and practically melts in your mouth. My wife said, yes, I'll have that. Our friends ordered an espresso. She said she'd be right back with the espresso, and dessert menus, so we could see if wanted to order anything.

This is a nice place and very low-stress.  The front desk people were exceptionally nice and very helpful in telling us of nearby restaurants.\\n\\nLastly, the southwestern style is of the room adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the place.

The staff was friendly.  The food was also fairly decent.  We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it.  You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix\/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid.  All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.

It's a small bar and if you're driving down Main St. you just might miss it. They have a small parking lot that can fit about 10 cars so best bet is to park out on the street. During the night, you don't even have to pay to park. \\n\\nWalking in, instantly my eyes go to the decor. Very modern and cool. They have a Buddha rabbit, Buddha chandler, & they have little tables setup with comfy couches.  The environment is very relaxed and chill unlike most hipster bars downtown. \\n\\nThe specialty drinks were not what I expected them to be. For instance, when I ordered Graveyard Of Champions.. The cucumber ice was Majority of the small glass. The actual drink was minimal. The presentation was cool but I basically paid $10 for a large round cucumber ice. \\n\\nAlso when me and my friends would order the same drink, they would taste completely different. This happened with more than 1 drink. One would taste amazing while the other would taste nothing like it. the bartenders paid close attention to you though.

She went to the back to ask the Manager on Duty - Paul if they could deliver tomorrow and was told no. Since my wife has done it many times before she asked to speak with the manager. Paul came out and began to make excuses like I don't know how many delivery guys I have tomorrow, the other store may take some of my delivery guys, I already know I have one order,etc. If you already have an order than apparently you do what we were asking.\\n\\nSince this is the age of reality shows, and Metro was actually on one, don't you think that customer service should be crucial to a manager's duties?

But I like that any menu item with avocado usually has a generous helping of it.\\n\\nI really like the hummus too (and the pita bread pieces that come with it, though don't let them get cold or else they'll be hard as rocks)- it's plain hummus with the sauce of your choice drizzled at the bottom of the cup and on top. I tried the garlic and the prickly heat (though it's a lot more sweet than spicy) and both were tasty. The garlic wasn't \\\"my coworkers are going to hate me in our afternoon meeting\\\" strong, so luckily they can just hate me for calling afternoon meetings. For $2.50 it was a nice side to my sandwich to make my meal of sandwich+hummus more filling.\\nYou'll probably find that it's \\\"just enough\\\" food - you won't get stuffed or squelch a ravenous appetite.\\n\\nI've tried a sample of their Java Mocha Blast and it was pretty good. There are similar drinks at Coffee Plantation and D'Lish, so much so that it gets hard to rank them but this one has a stronger coffee flavor and adds Nutella for their own unique twist to the peanut butter+banana+mocha.\\n\\nOh and it might be good to note that they serve the full menu the whole time they're open, so maybe next time I'll grab breakfast at lunchtime.\\n\\nOne downside is that they seem to run out of the hummus often by lunchtime :("}

{"label":0,"text":"This review is based strictly off their customer service.\\n\\nMy wife and I were going out for dinner last night at Muramoto.  We arrived early (5:30p) to the King Street area.  So, we thought we would stop by Nat Spil for a couple pre-dinner cocktails.  Neither of us had been there before and were excited to give it a try.\\n\\nOur initial take was we really liked the atmoshere - seemed very cool.  However, as mentioned in other reviews, we soon found that the place was small and a little confusing for us.  The place has about 10 tables that I could see and a small bar with about 12 stools.  Is it a restaurant or a bar?  The reason I bring this up is that when we walked in there were two couples sitting at tables and no one at the bar.  One couple had food and other couple just had cocktails.  There was no one to greet us when we walked in (i didn't think that was going to be a big deal but it obvioulsly was), so we sauntered over to the bar and ordered a cocktail.  After the drinks were poured we thought it might be more comfortable sitting at a table and told the bartendress - \\\"no problem\\\" she says.\\n\\nWe chose a table in the front window area.  It was small but had four sets of silverware.  Suddenly a waiter appears and asks if it just the two of us tonight.  \\\"Yes\\\" I replied.  He lets out a big sigh, and then snatches two of the silverware sets.  As he is walking to the cupboard to put them away I notice that he is shaking his head the whole time and is still visible pissed that there is only two of us.  He then takes the silverware he just cleared and started slamming\/throwing  them back into the cupboard drawers.  \\n\\nLet me take the opportunity to remind you that there were four other customers in this establishment at this point and it was 5:30pm.  It's not like we were occupying prime seats during prime time.  \\n\\nSo... The waiter comes back and says, \\\"what do want for dinner?\\\"  with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.   I said we were just having drinks and wouldn't be staying long.  Another hugh sigh and he storms off to his station and takes a big drink from his wine glass.  I was surprised to see the waiter drinking at 5:30.  I wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establishment's owner?!?\\n\\nWell that pretty much sealed it - not going to have a second drink there.  We slammed our cocktails and high tailed it.  As we were leaving we had to walk right past him.  He never looked up or even acknowledged we were leaving.  \\n\\nInterestingly enough... Around 8:00p as we were walking back to our car from Muramoto, we glanced into the front window of Nat Spil.  It looked they had a whooping crowd of about 6 people.  I wonder how many other people left after dealing with that ass-bag waiter?!?"}

Fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. \\n\\nThis place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. \\n\\nOne of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food."}

I came here for simple cleaning for my system, and it cost about $100 extra in comparison to what other shops charge for the exact service. After the cleaning was done, they didn't test whether my system was working correctly or not and said that they only did the cleaning. For the price, I expected at least a test.\\n\\nI needed an additional service for my car, but I won't do it in this shop because it's overpriced. Other than that, they're friendly and have a nice arcade waiting area."}

I told the waitress about them and didn't really get a sincere response. Next thing I see is another guy taking the box of blueberries somewhere else from the kitchen...I hope I don't get sick from it. Then I had the oscar omelet which was so so.

We were 3 people. We entered the suite and it was just as we saw on the virtual tour we took before reserving. Satisfactory.

In the showdown between smoking and food --- food lost.\\n\\nDrai's made up for the disappointment with a decidedly lush bordello-style interior, friendly bouncers, nice bartenders, strong mojitos AND free seats in which to rest my overworked feet.  It certainly helped that we were handed free entry coupons as we left the cab --- 'no cover' are two of the best words to hear together at a club.  \\n\\nThe music was more trippy\/trancy than anything else, but that was perfect for the time of night.  The sparse crowd (we were there early for an after-hours club --- 2am) ran heavily to wannabe Euro-gigolos in big bug-eyed sunglasses but started to fill later with a cross section of late-night dwellers.  It seemed like the kind of place where anything goes and nobody really cares.  That's not quite as good as mac-n-cheese at 3am, but it comes close."}

Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \\\"Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\\\"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!

It was really lacking flavors and the vegetables just felt thrown in. \\n\\nThe second time I came here for dinner and got the gnocchi and this one was really bad - almost inedible. Normally I can scarf down the food if I am hungry enough, but after a few pieces of this I really couldn't eat it. It's somewhat difficult to describe what was wrong with it - the sauce had a very strong flavor and it wasn't a good one.\\n\\nSince I clearly didn't enjoy the food, the last time I came here was a while ago.

Without getting into the painful details, the customer service we received was unbelievably bad.  They gave us a multi-thousand dollar written estimate (which required repeated requests to even get anything in writing) and it was hand-written on what appeared to be a scrap of paper.  So unprofessional.  Then, when we spoke with the sales team regarding a possible trade-in, given the price tag to fix my car, they were rude and inflexible. We couldn't get a straight answer or even a return call until ultimately we got in touch with the general manager of the dealership.  Apparently, they have had problems and she and her team are now trying to set things right.  She was the first and only person there that was helpful, and she certainly has tried to make things right.  That said, I was disappointed enough that I will not go back.  If you need a Mini dealer, definitely stick with North Scottsdale.  I promise that will save you a lot of time and frustration."}

Someone that finds jalapenos hot, should not be able to comfortably finish a suicide wing.

Holding a bun under tap water and smooching seeds with regular salt on it prior to serving, is not the way to make a Kummelweck bun. I can understand the bottom of the bun being already disintegrated from the beef holding water and spilled Ah Jus when I got the plate, but the top bun should not only not be cold and soggy, my hand shouldn't look covered in wet sand after I put it down. \\n\\n***Side note #3. Au Jus should not have more grease than broth.\\n\\nI'd requested a salad, which wasn't brought out with dinner. The leaves were slimy, the tomato was rotten and the cheese looked like it had been living there for a few days. \\n\\nMy sons sliders meal was ok.

The bar has a decent selection of alcohol with a few more specialized liquors you won't necessarily find everywhere else.\\n\\nThe service is also good, with staff that is friendly and accommodating. even when the place is clearly slow and they're probably not making what they should be in the way of tips compared to other Fremont Street servers on a Friday night, they still stay cheery and aim to please.\\n\\nBut, the pizza. It's badly made and clearly with the wrong cheeses and wrong seasonings in the sauce. The pizza here tastes like the horribly over sweetened crap you get at dominos. Or used to get at dominos.

It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened \\\"because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made\\\" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."}
{"label":2,"text":"Alright-- I'm a beer lover and generally a foodie. The food here is EXCELLENT, the beer is VERY good, and I've had both good service and slow service. Generally, though, the service is good.\\n\\nHowever, too many frat boys doing car bombs. Not my scene. I want to enjoy a good craft brew with some great food. If you're like me, you'll avoid the weekends. \\n\\nMy NUMBER ONE complaint about this place is that I brought in a growler and wanted to purchase their beer. They refused me because it wasn't 4 Peaks branded.  I have 4 peaks growlers at home, but it was dirty, so we didn't grab it. When I asked 3 other local breweries what they would do in a similar situation, I was told they would replace the growler or simply fill it. \\nI can understand not wanting to fill a blank growler but refuse me your product? Ah, no thanks. \\n\\nI made a trip to Tempe (which was out of my way), specifically to fill a growler of beer.  We went home with SunUp beer that night instead."}

{"label":4,"text":"Delicious! They have a happy menu and a healthy menu so this place can accommodate all types of taste buds. I got the dabayou (sp?) double patty burger with Cajun sweet potato fries. Those were the best sweet potato fries that I have ever had! The burger was pretty tasty itself, not as big as I thought it would be but it was good enough for me and I shared it with someone. I also got the jazz hands float (vanilla frozen yogurt or you could choose to put vanilla ice cream, sprite, and chopped pieces of mango). Then me and 2 friends shared rediculous off the breakfast menu (more of a dessert....) which is a red velvet waffle with a lighter version of the cream cheese frosting, blackberries and raspberries, chocolate drizzle, bacon, and syrup on the side. The prize ranged but averaged I would say 10-15. Their smoothies were pretty expensive, about $10. Parking was decent. It's a small place, could probably fit like 30 people. \\n\\nAlso, they offer free hugs so I took up that offer and the cashier was nice and she gave me a hug and everyone else at my table decided to get a hug. The art on the inside of the restaurant is pretty cool as well. Service is awesome, people asked if it was out first time and it was since we were visiting from San Diego so one of the guys explained the menu to us (so many options!). People checked in with us and served the food to us. You pay at a register then you get your food so you don't have to worry about paying afterwards or how to split a check! :)"}

The second visit was a little more than a solid 3 star (especially when considering the price), so I think I'll be generous with the average and maybe give this place one more shot before moving on to other high-end dining in Las Vegas. \\n\\nIn fact, I was just in NYC last month, but I didn't even bother to call Rao's as I knew it was futile.....I was geared up for my trip to Las Vegas in the coming weeks.\\n\\nAs mentioned, the first visit was phenomenal. The service was almost too attentive, our waiter told us about the history of Rao's (I grew up in CT, kinda of knew, but not really), gave us an excellent rundown of the menu and allowed us to be unpretentious with our wine choices. Two of us were sat in a booth in a busy, but sociable room off to the left side. \\n\\nWe went for the full-bellied Italian order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza, arugula salad, veal parm (on the bone!), with the tomato and ham vodka cream pasta. Oh, and don't forget the meatballs and gravy..... \\n\\nAlthough we were in a food coma (need to upload picture to prove it), we enjoyed the meal and wine thoroughly (and dreamt about the meatballs for months). We couldn't wait to come again. \\n\\nOur next visit was in July 09. We had a Caesar's concierge make our reservations and dined at a more reasonable hour before 9pm. Although the house was packed, we had a very competent, but indifferent waiter who may have spent too many years in the business to add anything special to the experience. With no other guidance other than \\\"whataya want?\\\", we fumbled our way without an app (no recommendation, no order), warm white wine (I had face my trashy side and put ice cubes in the wine) an uninspiring salad, and somehow, the \\\"parm and balls\\\" just didn't hit the same high notes. After moving to red, we didn't even finish the bottle. \\n\\nMaybe it was the summer season, the heat taking it's toll, the down economy on Vegas, or something hidden, but the place didn't have the twinkle of that first visit. \\n\\nOh Rao's, if you want America to buy those sauces and pastas now found from Kroger to Shop Rite, you better give people a memorable experience in your carnival sized restaurant. \\n\\nAlas, I'll give it one more try, if I'm not broke off playing craps by the time dinner rolls around that evening...."}

The mister got the chicken piccatta and we ordered dipping sauces ( marinara\/alfredo) for the bread.  I also ordered the minestrone soup and Caesar salad.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was good- they were a little heavy handed with the dressing but at least it did not taste like the caesar in a bottle- tasted almost homemade with a slight anchovy flavor.\\nMinestrone soup was also okay- had plenty of vegetables, beans and was not too salty.\\nMy spaghetti and meatballs was, well, spaghetti and meatballs- something I could've made at home.  The meatballs were nice and moist but had an odd flavor to me, tasted like they seasoned it with alcohol or something but it was fine after a few bites.\\nThe mister's chicken piccatta was actually pretty good, plenty of mushrooms and capers.  Just the right amount of lemon too.\\n\\nOverall, I would say it was a success.

{"label":0,"text":"Please do not waste your time. I am warning you. It is nothing like the website or a restaurant at all. It is merely a store front that has some meat in the back. Although there was a menu with several options we were only given two. They were ill prepared for dinner service but I can imagine the lunch is any better. I ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap. After returning the wrap I then received the flavorless meat on soggy bread with no sauce. It was not even edible. I was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their money off of a beer they charged us $5 for. The worst part is the website that is so deceiving. We were served food in styrofoam! Sitting in an alley with broken glass and a stereo playing bad music loudly. If you want to experience a little bit of Turkey, I guess the only option you have is to go to Turkey."}

In fact, it really doesn't look like anything at all, really. Groovy, mellow crowd hangs here, so it's not a real rowdy scene if that's what you're looking for.

They've expanded their offerings recently and now they do things from replacing your headlights to changing out belts.  My last trip there was an oil change, new air filter and car wash for $47 after tax.  They also do a basic car wash from $3.99 and a super was from $7.99.  I've never gotten anything but the basic, and I always find things they missed so while I'm not too impressed with their quality, it's nice to have the basics all taken care of in one location. \\n\\nThey have 48 hour guarantees on the washes, which is nice and when you get work done it always includes a \\\"limited time\\\" coupon for additional work.

{"label":1,"text":"I came here for a late lunch\/early dinner. There was one party of people in front of me and most of the restaurant was empty but there was still about a 10 minute wait. The d\\u00e9cor is somewhat sad when you think of a place that is in a hotel like Aria. The d\\u00e9cor looked old and faded with scuff marks all round. While the view was pretty I was seated at a table that had the sun shining directly in my face and there are no window shades. \\n\\nWe ordered the Fish & Chips and the Jambalaya Pasta. I have to say that the Fish & Chips was kind of a mess with the batter being kind of soggy and the fries just kinda bland. It wasn't worth the $22 bucks that it costs except for that it was a rather large portion. The Jambalaya pasta was another large portion and was decent but again nothing overly wonderful. The chicken in it was a bit dry and it was swimming in sauce. That dish was also $22 bucks but again wasn't really worth the money.  \\n\\nWe finished eating and didn't even want to bother taking our left overs. So we paid and got out as quickly as possible. I usually think that hotel coffee shops are pretty much the same with sub-par food and this one was the same. Which I think is a shame since there are so many other higher quality eateries in the Aria to choose from. You're better off grabbing some coffee and a pastry from Jean Philippe Patisserie."}

Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the \\\"Wonder Years\\\" TV show. \\n\\nI originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \\n\\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \\n\\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called \\\"The Texas\\\" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called \\\"The Alaskan\\\", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?.

They have a sushi happy hour, and they have customer appreciation every Thursday.  Their sushi portions are almost excessive and I've never, ever had a bad meal there.  Denise goes out of her way to say hello to everyone,and the sushi chefs will call out their welcome as you walk through the door.\\n\\nIf you're looking for the typical shiney Scottsdale atmosphere, you've come to the wrong place.

The hipster setting of Mile End is what it is and the staff were nice. For me still, the best real- Italian pizza experience is at  Bottega. I find them to be the winner.  Value for Money was not there with Magpie.  Wine \/ cocktails were way over priced for what you get, however the mixed cocktails were well put together."}

However, there is a lack of service here that needs to be pointed out. After our first night., housekeeping came in the middle of us having breakfast. I told them to come back in about an hour and we should be done. We got dressed and before we left the hotel, I called to request the room be serviced. When we came back, it was not serviced at all. All our dirty dishes and such were still hangin around. No towels refreshed. The next morning, we had to clean our own dishes before leaving.

Our empty glasses sat on the table for a good 30 minutes and after I was gonna hand them to another server he swooped by and picked them up only to continue to watch the fight Instead of bringing them back to the kitchen. He the. Handed them off to a waitress and continued to watch the fight. Clearly he was more concerned with what was on tv than actually doing his job.We will not visit this store again. \\nFood was AMAZING.

{"label":2,"text":"I've been to Sausalido several times over the past few years but have never written a review. We decided to go for restaurant week. The menu on the restaurant week website looked good. Two appetizer choices, a salad, and two entree choices for $25.14 including a corkage fee (BYOB). Hubs went with the restaurant week menu. In the mood for pasta, I went with the bolognese. The server brought over bread with their white bean\/balsamic spread. Very yummy, as always. \\nWe started with the quinoa meat(less)balls which was easily the star of the show. Anytime a healthy ingredient like quinoa is transformed into something so delicious that I can't even tell it's healthy, that's a homerun in the food world. Quinoa, cheese and marinara sauce, who would have thought? The next course was a salad with their white balsamic dressing. A standard salad topped off with blackberries, a nice surprise.  \\nMy bolognese arrived soon after the salad was cleared. Unfortunately, this is where the meal went downhill. The pasta was tender but the sauce lacked flavor for me. Although meaty, I was hoping for a more of a tomato base. I ended up taking most of it home for hubs who really enjoyed his risotto with bacon, arugula and blue cheese.  \\nThe service was also lacking. At the beginning of the meal we spent a significant amount of time looking around and waiting to order. When asking questions about the menu we were given either  a short answer or said he didn't know because he never tried it. Overall, some parts of our experience were fantastic while others were lacking."}

We walked over from our house and when we were seated we asked for water.  It took 5 minutes to get it and the water glasses were dinky.  Hello - this is Arizona!  We need something other than kid-sized glasses of water.  \\n\\nI ordered a happy hour martini and it was undrinkable.  After sending ti back, I ordered an oatmeal stout that tasted like flat Coke.  My wife had a blonde ale and she chose not to finish it (very unusual for her).  \\n\\nIf we hadn't already ordered dinner, we would have left at this point.  The buffalo chicken pizza was decent but very greasy.  The fried zucchini was inedible.  \\n\\nTo top it off, there was a networking event happening on the other side of the dining area.  Our pizza arrived at the same time that the event speakers began to use their mics to broadcast their message to the entire place.  I was treated to a diatribe about diabetes during dinner.  While this is a worthy cause, it was totally obnoxious during dinner..\\n\\nThe food is overpriced, the beer is mediocre, the happy hour menu is limited (no burger - really?) and the ambiance is horrible.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, we will not return.

Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.\\n\\nI went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for \\\"hot\\\"! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.\\n\\nWhen I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome!

The special was Bloody Mary's and I had to keep correcting him, by the time he was done...they were a site and he said he'd been working there over a year.  One patron had to ask multiple times for their check.  Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it. \\n\\nThe bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said \\\"oh well.\\\"  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?\\n\\nThe bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend. \\n\\nThe picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.  \\n\\nIn summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu."}

I'm only giving The Mission 3.5 stars because I thought the food was more beautiful than delicious.  My dad had the pork which was cooked appropriately for medium rare, but was a bit on the bland side.  I had the butternut squash tacos which looked wonderful--extremely colorful, but were also on the bland side in spite of the fresh lime wedges and slices of red chili (these tacos were also a bit pricey, $12 for 3 and the tortillas were the size of small sugar cookies).  My husband did seem satisfied with his hanger steak tacos.  Even though we planned on getting dessert, the consensus was that our dinner hadn't been particularly impressive so we opted to go elsewhere.\\nThere are a lot of rave reviews on yelp for the guacamole.

Two of the walls are glass walls so it added a really cool effect to the place, lighting up the whole room up. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty condensed but I kinda like that. Also everything is a pretty decent price. I asked the hostess for her opinion on what was popular and she was really helpful. I ordered fried fish tacos ($6) & wanted a side of kale salad because of all the positive buzz it gets! I just substituted the beans w\/ kale salad which was $1 extra. \\n\\nI ordered my food at 12:00 & did not get my food until about 12:30. And, it was not even busy. So I suggest you order your food before you arrive. I honesty think 30 minutes for 2 fish tacos is a little too long. A few of the costumers were also complaining of the wait. \\n\\nNow the food. The fish tacos were pretty good. Honestly nothing special about them but nonetheless they were good! The kale salad-- sorry, But I honestly did not like it. I was so excited to try it from all the buzz it got! I thought it was dry and it had a odd after taste. But maybe I'm just not a kale fan lol. \\n\\nI do want to come back & give them another chance.

{"label":1,"text":"Although the ambiance, wine store and service is superb, I find this to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Las Vegas. To describe the food as lack luster is actually kind. The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was \\\"wonderful\\\". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.\\nThe wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you."}

I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal."}

{"label":1,"text":"Located on The Las Vegas Strip. Yes, it's big and shiny, but I am not a particular fan of Aria or City Center in general. I will give a few reasons. The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}

{"label":2,"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever, so yesterday on my lunch break I decided to check it out. The inside is small, but homey. You can grab a table and look at the menu, and when you're ready to order you have to go up to the cashier and order there. The cashier was a nice girl named Mikayla. She was working alone and although there were only a few tables, she stayed busy! I looked at the menu for a few before I decided on the angry dog and the euro fries. I paid, just about $14, and sat down and waited. \\n\\nThe food took about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all considering everything is cooked to order. My food came out steaming, a good sign! The angry dog came piled high with spicy bulgogi, jalape\\u00f1os, slaw and spicy mayo. I had to eat it with a fork and knife it was that big. The flavors were wonderful. It wasnt too spicy at all, even with all the chopped jalape\\u00f1os. That was a damn good hot dog. The fries however, were just ok for me. They came with pork belly, cheese and garlic mayo on the top. I liked the pork belly and the mayo, but probably could have done without the cheese. The actual fries themselves were seasoned and wayyyyy too salty, so that ruined the dish for me. I ended up eating everything off the top and left almost half of the fries. \\n\\nAll in all I enjoyed everything and I will definitely be back because I want to try the chicken wings and the breakfast."}

{"label":2,"text":"I've been taking the light rail uptown to work for 2 and a half years, and all in all, I think it's a good system. It does need to be improved, but it is a good addition to the city, and I can't wait until they expand it so I can use it to get to more places. \\n\\nPositives:\\n-Convenience. I happen to live close to a station and work close to a station, so it doesn't get any easier than that. Even if you don't happen to live near a station, there are several Park & Ride stations for you to leave your car and take the train uptown for a night out, a performance, or a game. \\n-In general, the trains are clean, well-kept, well-lit, and not too crowded. I feel safe taking it and waiting by myself at the stations.\\n-For the most part the trains run on-schedule at reasonable intervals. \\n\\nRoom for improvement:\\n-The stations provide absolutely no weather coverage. Have you ever missed your train? Because I have more times than I'd like to admit, and have been stuck waiting for the next one in the rain. Yes, I was under the awning, but the awning doesn't do anything. Even the large covering at the Uptown CATS station leaves much to be desired. \\n-The trains need to run later hours, at the very least on the weekend. This is not just for the party crowd either. I work in a restaurant that closes at 11 on the weekends, and sometimes servers don't get out until almost 2 am, especially if they're closing. Sucks for you if the last train left at 1 am. There are groups of people besides the 9-to-5ers that depend on the CATS system to work the night shift.\\n-Trains need to be scheduled better when there are events uptown. Panthers game? Concert at Time Warner? Street festival? SCHEDULE MORE TRAINS. And run a double-length instead of a single-length. I have seen a little bit of effort regarding this, but many a time I am just trying to get home from work and get stuck behind 7,000 kids who just got out of Disney on Ice (see my review for Vida Cantina.)"}

As I got to the front of the line a polling assistant lead me to one of the election clerks sitting at the tables.

Verification is determined by the signature match on file, birthdate and address. Election clerk did not ask for any ID.  After signature verification, I was handed a plastic card and led to the polling area. From there the poll worker let me know which election monitor is available.\\n  \\nThe election monitors are touch screen and are activated once you insert the card inside the machine. Think ATM machine...that's how these monitors operate.  These screens were super sensitive I noticed.  Just a slight touch of the screen was all it took.  I followed the easy to read prompts on the monitor, made my choices, watched my ballot get printed and made sure it was all correct then casted my vote. Voila!!  It took about 3 minutes total.

It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar. \\n\\nI'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.  \\n\\nThe food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value. \\n\\nOur server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons\/employees who were hanging around. \\n\\nIf I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit. This one is just not worth the drive from the West Valley."}

{"label":0,"text":"Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!!\\nThis stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery. Else we would have done Barro's Pizza, which by the way is awesome!\\n\\nYes the website makes the process look cool but it is 2010 and I know high school kids with flashplayer skills that can do the same thing.\\n\\nOn to the food review!\\n\\nWe ordered a thin crust cali bacon chicken ranch pizza with mild chicken wings, cheesy bread, and that chocolate crunch cake thingy. \\n\\nThe Pizza and Bread... Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...\\n\\nThe cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one. \\n\\nThe chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \\\"what a waste of money.\\\" \\n\\nThe chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it. \\n\\nNext time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open. Considering In-n-Out and Denny's is right down the street from me I definitely wasted my money. \\n\\nIf you enjoy wasting money on pooh then by all mean go for it.\\n\\nI would give this place negative stars if I could."}

The guys who run it are pleasant, helpful and offer to find any products which they don't have in stock or recommend where you might find them.  \\nMy only criticism is that some of the things which they sell are a bit gimmicky and pointless.  For example, they were displaying an electronic rotating ice cream cone!  Does that appeal to anyone?  Possibly, but I can't help but feel that they'd benefit from specialising in stuff which people actually need.  Nevertheless, Marchmont Hardware offers top service and a great range of products at good prices."}

Dry brisket and sausages. Seafood bar without seafood. Had a small cup which had a handful of gamey shrimp and crab pieces in it. Needed a big mug of green tea to wipe my mouth clean after that. Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed. Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple. Imagine that... and they didn't even have to cook it at the hotel. Forget the hype and avoid this culinary waste space."}

The case is full of Oriental Delights, General Tao, fried rice, WonTon soup, stir fry, and veggie alternatives. If you want bubble tea, they've got em all, melon, black tea, green tea and fruit flavors. They do have fridges and fridges of pop, chinese style sodas, and beer. Sushi is also to go in a display case or fresh at the sushi bar. It's at reasonable price and close to the metro too."}

I was initially craving Mexican food anyway, so I didn't care.  \\n\\nThe service is awesome, the beer was so cold it was almost icy (read: awesome) and the salsa is yummy yummy.  I ordered the specialty chimichanga and my mom got rolled tacos.  The plates were hu-hu-hu-huge.  And can I just say that cream cheese makes everything better, especially chimichangas.  YUM.  \\n\\nNot the best Mexican joint I have ever been to, but definitely decent enough to visit again (for the locals)."}

If you aren't familiar with Chipotle, where have you been for the past ten years because it is the greatest place on Earth?!  Burritos\/tacos\/taco salads.  S.R. is basically the same besides the fact that the food is much worse.  Bad guacamole, bad queso, and gross meats.  The only good things about this place were that it was clean, relatively cheap, and you don't have fiery \\\"aftermath\\\"  (Think about that one).   Honestly, I will pay the \\\"Montezuma's Revenge\\\" price for the deliciousness of Chipotle rather than going back here again.  \\n\\nAll that being said, I still ate my whole burrito and chips & guac.  It was only good because I was starving.  All I'm saying is... Use your cool new smart phone device thingy and type in C-H-I-P-O-T-L-E and drive to that dot instead.  Trust me!

{"label":2,"text":"A Goodwill with no clothing?  What are they doing with all the clothes I donate?  Sending them to a less desirable location in Phoenix?  Only in Scottsdale.  In fact, this Goodwill is actually under the name \\\"Redesign by Goodwill,\\\" and sells only furniture (new and used) and household items. \\n\\nMy mom has an addiction, several in fact, including hunting for \\\"collectibles\\\" in thrift shops that she can consign for more.  The problem is if she buys 100 items for $1 each, and sells 2 of them for $5, she's made a profit in her mind.  Anywho, on her recent visit she insisted we visit a variety of thrift stores and garage sales.  This was our first stop.\\n\\nUpon walking in, I noticed it smelled like potpourri.  Maybe it was because they don't sell clothing, but in any case, potpourri beats the smell of a moth ball or old people.  Before I noticed the way this Goodwill is marketed, I was  astonished at some of the furniture.  Why it looked hardly used.  Because it wasn't.  There is some used furniture, however, and you'll know it when you see it.  There was a ton of other household\/kitchen items.  Not a bad place to get that kind of stuff as some was pretty reasonably priced.  Also, we went on a Saturday and found they offer half off of anything with a date over so many days old, so that's a bonus I guess.  I didn't buy anything, but my mom did.  I think she's going to end up appearing on Hoarders."}

Yes---you definitely have to watch out for the corners of the beds---the room is cramped and the base of the beds jut out. Also, our shower didn't drain well, but we were too tired to ask to change rooms for just one night. The hot-wire price was less than $40. Definitely a great deal."}

The first week we noticed they were open we went 3 times during the first week. They have a nice selection for vegetarians, which we love.  I love the falafel wrap, grape leaves, the salads, and the hummus a lot.  Our meat eating friends said the shawerma was flavorful as well.  The french fries are a must get as they are more like fresh chips than fries.  The staff have always been very friendly and helpful.

What?!?!?!\\nYeah one server.. with 1 person helping her. Needless to say everything was super slow and not right. \\nSeveral people had to ask multiple times for simple water refills. We finally just asked if we could have a couple of pitchers of water placed on the table so that we could help ourselves. We were told they couldnt do that. \\nSo you're saying that you're too busy to get us water yourselves and you're unable to allow us to help ourselves. Interesting. \\nAgain She was one person so almost EVERYONES order was wrong when it made it to the table. \\nBesides that she was so overwhelmed that she actually forgot to take the order of several  people at the table until AFTER the majority of us had received our food! \\nIt was a cluster all around. \\nThe food wasn't the worst but the service was so bad that I couldnt even upgrade their star based on the food. Besides I had the shrimp tacos and they werent that stellar.

I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner\/manager\/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.\\n\\nSecondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.  \\n\\nLastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.\\n\\nSo why one star?  Why bother to give one?

We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. The menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. I ended up getting the prime steak panini and potato salad. Great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). The potato salad was probably one of the best I've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich. \\n\\nUnfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. Slow service. It took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. I think I only saw the server once after my food came."}
{"label":1,"text":"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.

During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.\\n\\nThis is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \\\"who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\\\".\\n\\nI'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review."}

I give them credit for calling me well before the pickup time so I didn't have to wait at the shop. \\n\\nI have some concerns that my car was not test driven once the new brakes were put on and after them telling me all the problems they had. I hate to say it but I have some apprehension about the quality of the job. I could be totally wrong that cars don't need to be test driven once brakes are installed, but after hearing their woes about the install it makes me a little nervous.\\n\\n I must say that the staff is friendly and appears to be competent and from what I can tell the prices were reasonable. It was approaching closing time and they were rushing to get my job finished and I offered to even rent a car overnight so they could make sure they get it correctly and didn't have to rush. \\nI do have one objection that is more of a corporate thing and it is the shop fees. The shop fees added an additional 10% to my job cost and I just feel that that is high and somewhat outrageous. When I questioned the fee I was told every shop charges that but I just feel that 10% is too high.\\n I do feel that Brandon and his staff are trying to do a good job but on this particular visit I lacked full confidence that it was done correctly but it may have been, I just don't know. If this wasn't a safety issue I would just let this go and sleep well at night. \\n\\nI do not feel this is a bad repair shop, I just object to the corporate policy of 10% shop fee, and i feel they rushed through my brake job trying to meet a delivery time and left me feeling not confident everything is ok.

However, that's not to say that this isn't a gem to be enjoyed.\\n\\nOld Town Scottsdale on a Sunday afternoon (as I experienced it on vacation last week) is quiet and hot.  There wasn't too much to do and the kids were getting restless.  That being said, it was only 1pm and it was lunch time.  The bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road (Scottsdale Rd) in Old Town Scottsdale.  Besides, any place that's been around for 50+ years has merit with me.  \\n\\nOne piece of advice I'd offer is keep it simple.  A burger is an ok order, but stay away from the Reuben.  Should be simple, but somehow...outside of NY... I rarely get one that's worthy of the name.  And this was no exception.  \\n\\nBIG GRIPE:  No Fries???  They serve potato chips with all their sandwiches, no fries.  Don't get me wrong I like their \\\"Kettle Chips\\\" (which aren't made there, but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back).  But a true old time parlor should have french fries.  Ok, end of gripe.\\n\\nNow to the ice cream.  I won't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly I didn't have much.  I had a coffee shake which was quite good actually.  My mother-in-law got the '23 Skiddoo\\\" that I was eyeing and she was quite happy with it...  It was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream, with coffee syrup, sliced almonds, whipped cream & a cherry.  It looked great and got a thumbs up from mom.  My wife ordered a mint chocolate chip sundae (her favorite flavor) and enjoyed it.  The kids... well, the kids are easy to please.  Just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they're happy.\\n\\nOverall it was a good stop and had fantastic, friendly service. \\n\\nThe attached arcade left alot to be desired, but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor."}
{"label":4,"text":"Alchemy is one of my very, very favorite dining\/imbibing establishments anywhere.  Everything here is somewhere on the spectrum of excellent to amazing.  The staples on the daily menu are fantastic - their burgers are some of Madison's very best, and the specials, oh, the specials!  You have to go early because people are onto this place and they sell out fast.  It's worth the effort to get there, and it's worth the wait, even if it's crowded (it often is).  Bring cash or your ATM card.\\n\\nThe beer list rivals the food menu, with often-rotating beers including some that aren't seen often.  It's definitely one of the best tap lineups in town, and this is a beer town.  \\n\\nAlchemy is a very casual, unassuming tavern that doesn't necessarily tip you off to what awaits you when you order, and that's part of what makes it such a cool place.  \\n\\nThis is a somewhat short review but that shouldn't imply there's not a lot to say about Alchemy, because I could go on and on.  You'll be glad you don't have a lot to read because you'll get there sooner!"}
{"label":0,"text":"What a joke!  We drove all the way from Gilbert to see the spectacular lights. When we arrived around 6:15 the lights weren't on and everyone was wandering through the park trying to figure out what was going on. We started walking down the street when the park finally lit up around 6:45. YAWN. Oh, a few of the trees were amazing but the majority were just so-so.  Someone told us that all the trees downtown Glendale were lit along the street. When we left the street was still not lit. What a big disappointment. It would have helped had many of the stores been open, but alas, only a few scant ones were open. There was no hot chocolate or coffee vendors and only two glow stick sellers in the park. Definitely not worth the trip. Needs lots of improvements before we will return, if ever."}
{"label":2,"text":"I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. \\n\\nOverall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The Panang curry is so good (even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it)! And their Tom Kha Kai is amazing. Other favorites are the fried rice and Pad See Ew with beef. \\n\\nThe service is prompt and friendly."}
{"label":4,"text":"Excellent hotel right in the center of the strip. Great location with access to all of the nice casinos and shows. This was perfect for our family since it was smoke-free; can't stand cigarette smoke! I know I know.... Vegas and cigarette smoke! We go to Vegas to stuff our bellies and watch shows. Being inside of the Miracle Mile shops was a big plus since we can grab a quick bite to eat in the morning. Kind of funny but I love having an ABC store nearby; feel like I'm in Hawaii :-) The pool area was nice and safe for the kids. \\nWe stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. It was nice having a full kitchen, though we never used it, and a washer\/dryer was a nice touch, which the wife used. The rooms are nice and quiet. The kids loved the 8 ft. projection screen. Definitely a good compromise for the family with its upscale amenities and being family friendly.\\nThe only negative (and it's small) is the parking. During peak hours, it's hard to find parking since the parking structure is shared with PH and the Miracle Mile. You can pay the $15 valet and not deal with the parking issue. I may just do that the next time.\\nIf you are there to gamble and go crazy, this hotel may not be for you. If you want a quiet vacation in Vegas with the family still have the luxury to \\\"go crazy\\\", it's a perfect place.  We usually stay at the Palazzo\/Venetian but I think we found a new place to stay in Vegas!"}
{"label":3,"text":"First time I have been to Humble Pie and was glad to see that they opened one near my home on Happy Valley.  I added this place on Yelp and not even 12 hours later there was already 2 bad reviews for the service here.  I am sure they are still working out the kinks since our service was just okay as well but nothing to get \\\"panties in a twist about\\\".  We had a big table and sat outside with the nice heaters, the atmosphere was nice and new inside.  We ordered a side of french fries, fried green beans, and caprese for appetizers.  All of these were just great since the beans and fries came with mayonnaise based sauces that were awesome.  The caprese was different with cherry tomatoes (not my fav), liquified mozzarella, pesto, bread, and oil & vinegar.....although different I thought it was still very good but my wife did not care for it.  We both ordered pizzas, I had the SOP (sausage, caramelized onion, & peppers) and this was a great pizza with lots of great flavor.  The pizza is thin but the end crust is pretty thick and very good.  We will definitely go back and I am sure Humble Pie will work out the kinks on service but we were glad the service was decent for us."}
{"label":0,"text":"What a Capital Grille! This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least - we had an awful seafood tower - the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act."}
{"label":0,"text":"So, I have been to Pearl a few times now. The first time, it was ok, nothing spectacular but I liked the prices. The 2nd time- horrible. The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy.\\nWelllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn't explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is \\\"helping\\\" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks \\\"Did you order it with your server?\\\"....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn't even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I'd rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it."}

They had how many other water parks in the country? Who designed this place a class of kindergarteners? The lay out is stupid! The lazy river is tiny ! I have seen apartment complexes with bigger kids areas ! The life  guards ? All I have to say is I hope they never have to save anyone in my family! The movies in the wave pool! My tv is bigger and has better picture too! I am a season pass holder! 2 years now! It has not gotten better it's gotten worse!

{"label":3,"text":"Took the family last night and there was a 20 min wait.  Waiter gave us the specials for the night and provided good service.  The portions are very large so go hungry. The onion straws were tasty and so are the sweet potato fries.  Extensive list of beers.  Prices are reasonable.  It is consistently voted one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"label":1,"text":"Fuck this place. No bread served before the meals and the portions are TINY! Italian, by tradition, is served in generous portions, but these meals were so small that my girlfriend, her mom, and her grandma were all left ready for another helping. And it's EXPENSIVE.  For what it is.  Would NOT come back.  I almost laughed when the waitress offered dessert because I hadn't felt like I even had dinner. Headed to Wingstop now."}
{"label":4,"text":"Just getting back on a bike after many, many years. Great to have a bike shop that takes the time to answer questions and give advice because they want you to do it right. Did not buy my bike from them but they treated me as if I had. Great service and rider support."}

{"label":4,"text":"I was new to vaping and actually asked my wife to go in to the store (since we live closeby) and pick up some juice. The staff was very helpful and educated her on the product so she would understand what it was she actually was buying for me - I've been back and would consider myself a regular now - I buy my juice there (FlavorZ by Joe - CoolPort) and have also been getting my hardware there - Although I'm a tech nut, I'm kinda done with the internet shops - I've had some bad experiences - So I prefer to spend a few bucks more and visit a local store where the advise is instant, free and delivered with a smile. I suggest stopping in and giving them a try - Nice shop, clean and in a neighborhood where you can feel safe parking your car ;-)"}
{"label":1,"text":"I am using my Groupon for this place and its not a great start. We were left standing at the  front door for a good 5 minutes. My pet peeve is that they see u standing there but wont say anything!!! WTH Come on people a simple we'll be right you goes a long way. I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll pass"}

But, them sweet taters, n sweet tea was tasteeeee!  Mmmm, mmmm. I'm only knocking it down on the rating due to the noise being insane!!! However,  we had one in our party who was a lil picky about her prime rib, and the manager was courteous and prompt about offering a new cut, and fresh sides! Great customer service on the manager's part! Just be forewarned,  if you're looking for a quiet dinner spot around 8pm on a Friday night, best keep yer boots in the dust and keep steppin!"}
{"label":2,"text":"I like this a lot better than any of the other take out pizza in the area. This is a quick and tasty Sunday night dinner."}
{"label":1,"text":"The most inexpensive place to eat at the Wynn. \\n\\nAccording to Mr. Wynn the Pizza Place gives NY style pizza a run for its money. I beg to differ. \\n\\nI was really expecting the pizza to be excellent. It was only okay. You can order a pie or by the slice, start with a simple cheese pizza and add on ingredients and price. \\n\\nI had a \\\"cheese\\\" pizza with pepperoni, onions, and peppers. First of all I expected the peppers to be green but they were red. I also expected the ingredients finely chopped, they weren't.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was good but a little too greasy for me. With nothing but a fancy napkin to blot it with, I just didn't blot. The slices are big so that's a plus.\\n\\nAlso tried their basic vinaigrette salad which was okay, again not the best and the dressing wasn't mixed that well against the greens (come on people).\\n\\nMy favorite thing here was their iced tea that had a hint of passion tea but wasn't sweet. \\n\\nDue to the wind outside we were forced to sit inside and were not able to enjoy the sounds of the waterfalls outside."}
{"label":3,"text":"Their dark chocolate truffles are probably the best in Charlotte. Their prices match the quality; the only off note is that if they want to charge Teuscher like prices I expect something a bit more upscale than a cheap bag when I pay $10 for 4 truffles. Please if you're selling high end truffles wrap them with the respect they deserve and that I have paid for."}
{"label":4,"text":"I have been wanting to go to the one and only \\\"Cambodian\\\" restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and LOVED it from the moment we entered. An aura of love, peace and harmony welcomed us in. LOVED the food!!!!!! It was my husband's 1st adventure  into Cambodian cuisine. He is an adventurous spirit and loves most cuisines so I knew he would treasure the unique flavors of Cambodia. It was cooked by Mom who used to work for Intel. Served by son and daughter. Even though it was busy he found time to converse with us. It was one of those lingering, thought provoking, conversation provoking experiences that stays with you until your next visit."}

{"label":4,"text":"I remember trying this place 2 years ago and I was not impressed. About a month ago I decided to give them another chance, and tried the Kung Pao Chicken, and since then I have literally been back 6-7 times. For the price it's the best Kung Pao I have ever had. The vegetables are fresh, the sauce is unique and there's plenty of peanuts, an ingredient that imo makes or breaks a good Kung Pao. Their lunch and dinner combos come with fried rice something I don't care for but their fired rice isn't bad at all."}

{"label":2,"text":"Went for a quick lunch (before we had to leave for the airport) and it was just fine.  The atmosphere is modern, prices are reasonable, and the location was prime.  The service wasn't the best - we had to ask for our server at least 5 times before he came over....twice.  \\n\\nFood:  had the $15ish chicken salad, which sounded similar to Corner Bakery's chicken salad (yum!).  This was not as flavorful but was fine because the raisin bread which it was served on was yummy.  I'd rather have Corner Bakery's, especially at $6!\\n\\n3 people ordered the primer burger - 2 ordered theirs medium, 1 asked for medium well.  All of ours came out medium rare (bright red \\\"bleeding\\\" in the middle of our burger).  The medium people dealth with it and ate...but it was unacceptable for the person who ordered the med well (rightfully so!) - it took 10 min for them to take it back and then another 10 min for them to bring back the same burger that came out very charred on the outside.  \\n\\nGood for lunch, wouldn't go for dinner.

All I wanted was something clean and affordable for the night, and I got much more. Staff was genuinely courteous, Fitness Center was much more than I expected, and there's a nice pool. The courtyard in the middle of the property reminds me of (a very toned down version of) the Royal Hawaiian in Waikiki with subtle palms and good accent lighting. \\n\\nVery clean property. Free WiFi (although the connection speed leaves a little to be desired), Free Valet Parking, and even a complimentary water bottle at the gift shop -- which came in handy because I went for a run outside and it's HOT!\\n\\nIf you're here on a weekend during the school year, be prepared for Mill Avenue to be pretty rowdy (think: Bourbon Street). But I enjoy the energy it adds to the area. Didn't have a problem with street noise interfering with sleep.

My 3 stars are for very slow service and a meal lacking any flavor. I ordered the \\\"tri-athlete\\\" breakfast: egg white veggie omelet (usually with salsa on top), side of cottage cheese and a toasted english muffin. Despite what some people may think, there is no reason why healthy meals can't be packed with flavor. Yes, even without the bacon (gasp!).\\n\\nThe omelet was cooked decently but it didn't have any seasoning to it. Basically I struggle to rave about because I can replicate and exceed it at home. Now, my friends enjoyed their breakfast- especially the pumpkin pancakes (a specialty during the Fall only). Our server took enough time to come and refill coffee and take our orders that we often had to hunt her down so we could finish our breakfast in under 2 hours. \\n\\nI'm sorry this review lacks wittiness, charm or good writing.

First thing we see is a waitress complaining that the order she's holding was not what the customer wanted, and another waitress was kind of arguing with her about it.  FInally got seated, then waited at least another 5 minutes before our waitress came by, who happened to be the complaining waitress above.  She asked what we wanted to drink, my wife said coffee, and then I told her we're ready to order.  She then said we'll have to wait a minute and took off.  Again, we waited another 5 minutes, no coffee in sight, and noticed no one was getting their food, and another waitress was apologizing to folks about why it was taking so long.  We ended up walking out, which we rarely do unless service is horrible, which this absolutely was."}

Pizza Hut, Papa John's, and Dominos are THE worst and sadly the most popular. Ever since Li'l Ceasars made a return to the area, but they've gone downhill in the quality department....either that or I was really just a dumb teenager who didn't know any better. (Hey, Godfathers was great back in the day, too!...I think.) Cici's isn't \\\"pizza\\\" like Taco Bell isn't \\\"Mexican\\\", so don't even bring that up. It's just garbage. Donato's is okay, just pricey.\\n\\nThere are better pizzas to be found in the area, but this review is for \\\"chain restaurant\\\" pizza and Hungy Howie's is probably the best. It reminds me of the pizza Little Ceasars made back in the day. It's fast, it's cheap, and it's pretty damn tasty. It's gotta be the crust...the garlic-butter crust. I've tried their other flavored crusts but this one can't be beat. This is one of the only chain joint that knows how to properly cook their pepperoni. The edges of the pepperoni get that little bit of char around the rim. Deeelicious!\\n\\nYour pal,\\nWalter"}
{"label":3,"text":"I love staying at this hotel because of the modern design and layout. I think it is more suited for younger crowds with all the technology and gadgets located in the rooms. Everything from the t.v. to the curtains opens when you first enter the room. So many crazy buttons to press, but that's what makes things fun. The beds and pillows are really comfortable and they have a flat screen t.v. with all these ports! I suggest bringing an HDMI cable if you want to play any movies or shows from your laptop onto the big flat screen. This place is also good since it is kind of located in the middle of the strip so it is easy to get to the nearby hotels. I would stay here again on my next visit."}

Me and my family recently moved and this is the closest location to us. I will never eat here again! The service was HORRIBLE.

When we were heading out a guy walked out yelling \\\"Horrible, horrible\\\" to everyone in earshot. It was...well, bad. We didn't see any sign of Ne-Yo until after midnight, and by then he was so f'ed up that everything he said and sang was just pathetic. For $100\/guy and $50\/girl, all they did was blow paper confetti at midnight. The entire experience lacked anything special. With that fat of a cover and no live music performance by your headliner, you should at least hand out some cheap champagne. \\n\\n3 shots of well vodka and a vodka martini were $56. The entire club (which has multiple rooms of different styles of music and no real room to dance in any of them) has donated all possible space to VIP booths. Many of those are nowhere near the action, so you have to get up and leave, making your booth susceptible to theft. I don't recommend bottle service at this club. I'm glad we didn't go for it. If you aren't a VIP, however, good luck finding anywhere so much to even lean, as they've profit-maximized every square inch of the interior. \\n\\nAdditionally, so many people were chain smoking within an area of so little ventilation that I became literally sick to my stomach and had to excuse myself from the club entirely. I'm pretty used to the nasty smoking liberty people in Vegas abuse, but this was a little overboard. \\n\\nMusic was house\/EDM samples, nothing Top 40 or dancey. Nothing unique to the DJ stack at all - you'll find these types of mixes anywhere. Pretty weak. Pro's of the club were the bouncers\/security (who I found to actually be pretty accommodating), the cleanliness, and the multi-room concept. The decor also differed between the rooms, which was cool. \\n\\nAll lovelies aside, I don't see myself returning to this club."}

I had emphasized that I prefer a blunt bob with minimal, blended layers, but the stylist just did what she wanted to do I guess.

{"label":2,"text":"As stated by a previous Yelper, the Luxor is showing its age. While the entrances and walk ways seem to be well cared for, other parts of the hotel are in need of renovations.

Plus the lobby area to the 2nd floor smelled like diapers and the walls looked old and dingy.\\n\\nThe room served its purpose since we were only sleeping and bathing there so for bare essentials it was ok. The bathroom needed a little work as the sliding door to the shower did not slide easily and the towel rack connected to the door was broken. \\nOther than that my only concern is that I would liked to have had an added security lock other than the deadbolt on the door. \\n\\nIt wasn't too bad for the price that we paid for but I may want to check out other places prior to booking with them again."}

One of our charges was for an upgrade which they say my husband agreed to although he never did.  Another thing they did was charge us for fuel.  They told my husband it was cheaper to have them fill up the vehicle when he returned the car.  That may have been true if the vehicle was returned empty.  They charge you for a full tank of gas despite what you use.  They failed to mention that.  I'm sure it was it the small print somewhere so our mistake but consider it a warning.

{"label":2,"text":"I still like the Tropicana but am really, really disappointed in the pool closing. When I started looking for my replacement hotel (used to love the stardust) that was one of my \\\"must haves\\\". A pool & hot tub open all year. It used to be, at least the indoor pool and hot tub were open all year. Now they close it for the winter? It may be winter to Las Vegas natives but many of your guests are from real winter states and 70-75 degrees is plenty warm enough to go for a swim or to sunbathe. Not only does the pool close but they lock the grounds also so you can't even go out and sit in the sun on a lounger or take a walk in the grass. There is no reason I can think of that guests shouldn't be able to go out and sit in the \\\"resort\\\" area by the pool and gardens even if no swimming is allowed.  I'd love to hear the reasoning on that. For a $20 a day so called \\\"resort fee\\\" where's the resort part? Perhaps there should be a discount when the pools, hot tub and grounds are \\\"closed for the winter\\\"? No where in the advertising does it say this. I still love many things about the Trop, especially our casino host, and she is now the main reason I still stay here since to me the pool and grounds are enough to make me move. I haven't conviniced my other half yet but I have opened the conversation. If at least some of these things don't change for the better I will start looking again for a new casino to stay at.  We come several times a year, every year. Please reconsider at least the grounds being locked and allow those of us who live where there is actual winter to enjoy some sun. This last trip was quite disappointing. The pool area was opened until Friday the 14th but the nicest, warmest day, Saturday November 15 it was all of a sudden \\\"closed for winter\\\"?

{"label":2,"text":"Whole Foods was easy to find - if you are somewhat familiar with the area you will have no trouble locating it.  While parking on a Thursday evening was no issue, I can see that this place would be unbearable on the weekend.  The surface lot stayed full the entire time I was there, and while there is underground parking, there aren't a LOT of spaces.  The underground lot is very well lit with several emergency phones.  The parking spaces are a good size, so folks aren't dinging doors.\\n\\nThe store itself is well designed and utilizes every inch of space for either products or seating.  I was impressed by the size, cleanliness and organization of the store.  I briefly walked up and down a few aisles and did see that the prices on items that I get from HT (namely the Amy's organic brand) were either the same or slightly higher than HT.  There were a lot of choices for gluten-free products.  I don't know that I would say WF is overpriced, as I believe that quality items are worth a little more (if indeed they are of a higher quality to justify the higher cost), but the prices for the products that they do carry do seem to be higher than HT on comparable items.\\n\\nThe staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Whenever I asked questions of the staff, they were quick with a smile and some friendly assistance.  Good customer service goes a long way!  \\n\\nThe prepared foods section is VAST.  There is a refrigerated section with foods portioned and ready to go (salads, wraps, soups, quiche) and there are also several food bars with salads, hot items and soups.  The dessert bar was beautiful (cupcakes, cakes, cookies, pies).  Nearby there was a large selection of sushi.  A deli section with noodles, prepared salads, veggies.  A gelato bar that looked incredible.  Pizza by the slice or entire pie (they also had take-and-bake pizzas in the refrigerated section).  And I believe there was a blended beverage bar as well. \\n\\nThe salad bar had standard fare with a few upgrades.  The salad is $7.99\/lb. and salad is surprisingly heavy.  For a small salad with a drizzle of dressing, plus a spoonful of potato salad, I paid almost $9.   A small cup of Smoky Bacon Tomato soup ($2.49) that was delicious.  I could not resist some sweets and got a piece of strawberry cake for $4.49.  YUMMY!  Soup and dessert were winners, salad was nothing special.  Thumbs up for the green packaging products\/utensils and very well labeled recycling centers.  \\n\\nOn the 2nd floor, there is more indoor seating as well as a very large outdoor patio with tables and cushy chairs. The 3rd floor contained another few tables and the classroom.  The classroom overall appeared very nice - pleasing colors, clean, shiny.  There are several cameras pointed at the cooking area and 2 flat-screen TV's for viewing what is going on.  \\n\\nI attended the Cheese Board class ($25).  We were each given a plate with slices of different kinds of cheese, plus a small plate with fruit spreads, pesto, and honey, along with a piece of paper with the names of the cheeses and room for notes.  The two instructors did a pretty good job explaining the different kinds of cheese, how they're made, etc.  I am guessing I don't have the refined palate needed to appreciate what was served.  The tastes for me ranged anywhere from 'meh, that's okay' to 'this tastes like soap'.  The others in the class seemed to enjoy them all, so I believe my lack of enthusiasm is just an indicator of my Kraft taste buds and not the quality of the cheeses.  Wine and beer was poured to test how the cheeses could be paired.  The fig and tart cherry spreads served were out of this world .  At the end you get to try the cheeses again, with different pairings, and ask questions.  Informative class, good instructors, I give the class-experience itself a solid B.\\n\\nMy MAIN problem, which will keep me from signing up for actual cooking classes (which are $50+ per class) is the chairs are too damn close together.  You had best go with someone you love because you are going to be sandwiched right on top of them.  The chairs literally touch one another.  The woman sitting next to me pushed her hair behind her ear and her hair brushed my shoulder.  True story.  Unless you are buying me dinner and going home with me afterwards, you shouldn't be sitting that close to me.  If the seating area was more comfortable, I would go to several of the classes a month, but my anxiety over sharing oxygen with a stranger in such close proximity will cause me to look elsewhere for cooking classes.  \\n\\nWhole Foods was a neat experience... if I was a woman of leisure with money to burn, I could definitely fall in love with it.  But since I am a full-time working girl who has to keep the lights on, I will save Whole Foods as a once-in-a-while splurge and stick to hometown Harris Teeter for my day-to-day grocery needs."}

So my husband went up early to call for one at 5:25pm.  I got up there at 5:53pm and the taxi was STILL not there.  We missed the reservation and had to BEG to \\\"get in\\\".  ONLY to find out, the Bell Desk walkies the other Bellman who stands at the entrance of the resort to wave-in taxis!!  WHAT TOOK SO LONG!?? \\n- With the above in mind, they wouldn't call ahead a taxi for the airport either.  But they did say there is a complimentary shuttle to take us and that all we would need to do is call to arrange it.  So, we followed instruction only to discover that the shuttle is not complimentary, it's not private, and the shuttle servicers are quite the assholes too (likely because we were misinformed and we wasted their time). \\n- The water.  Stay away from the water.  I am sure it's \\\"clean\\\", but Vegas water tastes like shit.  \\n- Lastly and the most terrible was the thumping on Saturday morning!!  At 9am, we were rudely greeted by the loudest thumping I've ever heard.  I called and it was due to Building 21 is doing maintenance.  Really?  These people are working while I am supposed to be enjoying my vacation??  They really cannot wait on that specific project until 11am?  \\n\\nOnto the \\\"time share\\\" portion of our trip.

{"label":1,"text":"Being from PA, this is the closest Pizza to those we used to get back home. Great and crispy crust. Very impressed. \\n\\nThat being said, this place is very expensive for no reason. The portions are not great and it's just good ol fashion pizza with ordinary ingredients. $17 for a 12\\\" pie is a bit ridiculous. \\n\\nWe also ordered the zucchini fries which were way over battered and there are only about 9 pieces for $6+.\\n\\nAlthough I am a fan of the pizza, I don't see my self dropping $30 on a 12\\\" pie, zuchini fries and cheese bread."}
{"label":4,"text":"We have been dining here for over one year and heartily recommend the venue!  The experience begins with smiles and greetings when you enter!  The wait staff truly aim to please!  We have had exemplary service from Judy, Sandra and Fabi...!  The chef always provides excellent, tasty meals!  Also, he will make French fries topped with green salsa and cheese! Must comment on the cleanliness of the entire restaurant and bar!  We think Baja Joe's does not have an equal in the east valley; so, we find ourselves dining there several times per week!"}

{"label":1,"text":"The first time I went to Sauce, I had a sandwich, and I really liked it. I also really liked the retro decor of the place. It was different and seemed non-chain-like (whatever that means). The second time I went to Sauce, I had their pepperoni pizza, and it was, eh, okay. Nothing special...at...all. It was greasy and there was too much cheese for the thin crust to hold up so the slices were kinda limp when you picked them up. I've had better pizza from places like Ray's Pizza and Sardellas for a much more reasonable price. \\n\\nThe biggest problem I had with this second visit was that a few minutes after we sat down, they brought out my Mom's sandwich, but didn't bring out the pizza until probably 15 or 20 minutes later. H-E-L-L-O?! My Mom was already halfway done with her sandwich. We ordered them all together, so why didn't they bring the entire order out at the same time? That is a very bad way to serve food.  But, I do have to give them a little props because the manager came out with the pizza and apologized for it taking so long.  \\n\\nI think Sauce is pretty much overrated. The decor and look of the restaurant is kinda cool, but they need to work on their pizzas. I'll probably go back, but only for their sandwiches from now on."}
{"label":4,"text":"We USED to be RigaTony customers back in the day when they 1st opened their location at Az ave and Knox. Went there for years...until the neighborhood and  RigaTony's quality and service went WAY downhill. It was no big surprise when that location closed. We quit going altogether.\\n\\nOn a whim, (and hoping for the good old days when this place was one of our faves...) we tried their \\\"new\\\" location-- at Warner \/ McClintock-- I guess it has been there about a year+ so I figured that was enough time to get it together.Lucky us, Monday night is \\\"Kids eat Free\\\" night. With two toddlers in tow, this was a bonus!\\nNot packed, but kind of busy for a Monday , we were greeted and seated right away. Our server was right on us and got our bev order. She also suggested that she could put the kids order in 1st, so they would not have to wait...great idea.\\nThe herb-bread with olive oil for dipping was even better than I remembered. And the antipasto salad included with the meal had generous portions of meat, cheese, tomatoes,onion, peppers, olives with house dressing, was fresh and very good. My wife who is allergic to onions, asked our sever to make her a salad without, and she was very accommodating...\\nNot really sure what to try, I opted for the \\\"Tour of Rigatony\\\" plate which included a generous (more than a sample) portion of what I guess is their more popular items:Chicken Picatta, stuffed shells, fettucinni alfredo, and a huge italian sausage ( kind of spicy, to my delight!). This dish is for the hungry appetite...I brought half home; it's a lot of food for $14.95!\\nThe wife ordered the Capellini Seafood dish: Clams, mussels, shrimp sauteed in a very light white wine\/butter and herb sauce, placed over angel hair pasta. She seemed to really enjoy it. I tasted it and the seafood was fresh and prepared very nicely. It also was a large serving.\\n\\nWe remembered that in the good old days, Rigatony's desserts were awesome, so we ordered the Tiramisou, and chocolate layered cake. These were truly scrumptious! \\n\\nAll in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.... service and food was great! Price was very reasonable for the amount of food...\\n\\nThe Mgr was making his rounds to each table making sure our evening was satisfactory....I related my story as a returning customer, and told him that they have won us back as regulars! The biggest compliment was from our 5 year old: \\\"This is WAY better than Olive Garden! \\\""}
{"label":0,"text":"Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience."}

{"label":3,"text":"Myself and a small group of friends have become regulars here.\\n\\nI've always had great service, with maybe 1 exception (a waitress I haven't seen in a long time...).\\n\\nWhat's the key? TALK to them. They're a great group and if you're friendly, they're friendly. Any good sushi bar I've been to is social. If you want quiet and intimate, go to one of the snotty overpriced Scottsdale restaurants.\\n\\nJade is about as good as they come. We've had such a blast with her - she's even taken sushi from our table and given it to others, which then got us all laughing and talking. And since it's all you can eat, so what?\\n\\nYes, there are rules, but every a-u-c-e sushi place has them. There isn't anything unreasonable and if you've been to any of the other ones (I can only think of 1 that is still around in that general west-valley area), it's one of the least restrictive. Trust me, you can get belly-busting full without breaking any rules.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, there is an automatic gratuity. I'm also not a big fan of this practice, however, I justify it in my mind that you're not just tipping the server, you're tipping the sushi masters. I never leave without adding additional tip anyways, so it's a become a non-issue for me.\\n\\nGo to get stuffed, or go to try an assortment of different sushi without worrying about paying for something you don't like - it's all good.\\n\\nIf someone in your party doesn't like sushi, they have a regular menu that's pretty typical - teryaki chicken and the like. Enough that it shouldn't stop a non-fish eater from going (but who'd like those people anyways??? LOL!)"}
{"label":1,"text":"The high roller is at the end of a trendy row of casino and clubs. It's geared toward a younger crowd and has an outdoor club feel. The night time ride is $37 a person. It was not an amazing view since you see the parking lot in the rear of the area for most of the ride. There is a person who CEOs on the screen and explains what height your at and does a apex countdown. I would go once to say you've done it but it's not as fun as the bars on the ground."}

The french toast is amazing, one order can easily be split between two people.  Sunday's seem to be busy but I have not had to wait more than 15 min. and they don't rush you when you are seated."}

{"label":4,"text":"I recommend Sonoma Grille without reservation.  I have, as of this review, eaten lunch there three times, and each time the food has been amazing, the prices have been extremely reasonable, the portions have been just right, the meals have come out fresh and staggeringly quickly, and the wait staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  The decor is gorgeous, the tables are neither too close to nor too far from one another (there's plenty of seating away from the bar), and it really is, TARDIS-like, bigger on the inside.  \\n\\nNow, normally, I like to recommend particular dishes.  I'll do that here, but understand that the Sonoma Grille menu changes with some frequency (it has done so once since the first time I ate there about six weeks ago).  If these things are still on the menu, I recommend the Pittsburgh Chopped Salad (so named, I believe, because of the crispy shoestring potatoes on top of it), the Amish Chicken Breast with fetuccine, the panko fried shrimp appetizer (which is what popcorn shrimp wants to be when it grows up - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spiced to perfection), and the sweet & spicy salad.  You can add a protein to any of the salads - for the PGH salad, I added salmon, and for the sweet & spicy one, I added chicken breast.  \\n\\nEvery time I've eaten there, I've been blown away.  And I haven't even checked out the wine menu yet!!"}
{"label":2,"text":"With all the rave reviews I have read about Big Boys, I was expecting great results! Maybe I expected too much out of this small pizza joint. We ordered a 16'' pizza, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders for dinner to be delivered to our house. People mostly compliment the place's large single slices, and maybe for the price that would've been a better option for lunch time. But for dinner and a full pizza for the price, it wasn't anything to write home about.\\n\\nDelivery: 5\/5 Pretty standard delivery times. We ordered around 8PM on a Sunday night, and received our food at around 8:30 or 8:45. The ease of online ordering was great, also!\\n\\nPizza: 3\/5 Okay pizza. Tasted more 'home-made' than the big-brand counter-parts like Pizza Hut or Domino's. Pretty decent amount of cheese, and the pepperoni used was good. Nothing really 'special' though.\\n\\nMozzarella sticks: 2\/5 It's pretty hard to mess up mozzarella sticks, but these for some reason just tasted... off. Maybe it was the oil used to fry them, or maybe the flour\/breading used. Just didn't taste 100% to me.\\n\\nChicken Tenders: 3\/5 Same complaint as above, really. They had a weird after taste, either attributed to the fryer oil or breading. The chicken itself seemed like a pretty decent portion for the price. \\n\\nAll in all, I probably WOULDN'T order another full pizza from this place again. I may try out some of their other options, like the fries or garlic knots and only order a slice of pizza, as others have done."}
{"label":1,"text":"I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$."}
{"label":4,"text":"This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.  \\n\\nThe lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"label":3,"text":"I really do just love this place...from the very first time I set foot. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my friend and I waited for about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded.\\nI recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!"}
