We must have played for over an hour before we were even offered a drink, and another half hour to get the drink.  This is probably the 4th time in a year - bad service as far as that goes.  Otherwise, it's a cool place for an older casion\/hotel."}

Great sandwich to eat while walking, nice staff member and a great deal for 2 bucks."}

The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."}
{"label":3,"text":"Have I ever been to smashburger? No. And now, I can say I have. So this place is neatly located in the stonecrest area full of restaurants and all your south side 5 second drive cravings.\\n\\nMy brother advised me to make my own burger. And I took his advice and did just that. I ordered an egg artisan bun, aged Swiss, tomato, lettuce, grilled onions, an egg, and mushrooms topped with spicy chipotle sauce. And of course some smash fries. How was it, you may ask?\\n\\nWell, this place is definitely place on my list to come back to. The burger was juicy, and with all the condiments loaded on there it came out pretty neat. I think I could've had more out on it, but I didn't want to try my luck with a burger that topples over to the point where it isn't a burger anymore. My philosophy: it's okay for mission burritos, no good for burgers on overloading condiments. \\n\\nThis place was a quick meal with a good amount of seating. With a feel of old school dining mixed in with the new. Pick up a menu, go to the counter, order, and sit down for your masterpiece (or a default burger) to come greet your burger cravings. \\n\\nOverall, this place is worth looking into if you're into burgers and a little freedom as far as creating what you want to taste. This place will be on my list if I'm in town and looking for a burger."}

You get to choose from two proteins, I chose fish tempura and yakitori and it also comes with miso soup, a spring roll, a California roll, gyoza, rice and salad. Wow, was I super impressed. Everything tasted great and the portions were decent as well. For that price you would expect lesser quality so I was stunned at how good everything was. Too bad it's on the other side of town otherwise I would be in here every week."}
{"label":2,"text":"This place is probably the definition of an 'alright' time in Vegas. Groupon really pulled a fast one on me and my girlfriend. For starters the Concierge is slow and unfriendly, when we arrived AND checked out the line stretched to the main entrance WITH a full staffed counter, resulting in a 20-30 minute wait.. no lie. They upgraded us to the Paradise Tower King Pool-View which was cool but the room wasn't anything special, it was REALLY dark. Literally its a dim room in the daytime and nighttime with the lamps on. THOSE BEDS THOUGH they are the best beds I've slept on in Vegas. It also takes forever to navigate this place, the towers are so darn far from each other making the trip from the room to the pool or the casino floor a literal 10 minute trip. Not To mention the standard $9 trip to and from the Hardrock to the Strip. No one was really at the pool either. If you have a option, pass on this place."}
{"label":3,"text":"My first time trying BurGR was at an Elite event last year.  We were lucky enough that night, to try the majority of the menu.  It was all amazing.  My table quartered the burgers so we could try different ones.  My faves were the Britannia Burger and the Euro Burger.  I didn't care for the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pop.  Cool idea but I could do with less salted peanut ice cream.  Recently I went back again with a friend from out of town who was staying at Planet Hollywood.  I got the Uber Cheese Burger  and the #4 shake.  My friend got the Farm Burger, #5 shake and we shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Everything was just as good as the first time.  We didn't have to wait long for a table and service was attentive.  Prices were average for a celebrity chef restaurant.  I only wish it wasn't such a pain in the ass to get anywhere in Planet Hollywood."}
{"label":0,"text":"Upon booking my room about a month before my stay, I requested early check in. This because we were flying in and I knew it was going to be HOT. Before I even boarded  the plane i called the Tropicana again just to reiterate the need for early check in. I was told they had my initial request on file and it shouldn't be a problem. I was informed to just head over to the hotel. Once I'd gotten to the hotel which I'll admit was about 10:30am and really early, i asked if there was a room available. Not shocked that there wasn't because of the time i checked my bags. Jo Ann told me to check back in a few hours and we should be ok. Will kill time getting good and drinks then arrive back at the hotel at 1:00pm. Jo-Ann informed us again that there still weren't any rooms ready. She says to check back in at 2:30pm. I'm thinking,\\\" Really? I requested early check in and regular check in is at 3:00 but you want me to come back at 2:30?\\\" I bite my tongue and kill another 1 1\/2 hours with my friend and more drinks. At 2:30pm on the dot we are in front of Jo Ann again,\\\" She tells me AGAIN there are no rooms available. At this point I'm not very happy but i keep it together. She says and I quote,\\\" Early check in is not guaranteed but a request. It looks like its going to be more around 3:30 before I can check you in. You should be lucky that you are even getting a 2 queen room because we are sold out this weekend. We have to accommodate our Diamond Club Members and well as hotel invited guest first.\\\" I was in utter shock. That was it! I told her,\\\" I should be lucky to get the room I PAID you for a month ago?! Ok...\\\" At that point I just walked away. I've learned that the people at the desk have to answer to someone so just contact the person the answer to. I get the hotel manager on the phone who is more than apologetic when I tell her that I was made to feel like my money was not wanted and that I was less important than their precious Diamond Club Members. Literally within minutes she tells me both my and my friends rooms are ready. How funny is that. I go back to the counter to check in and was lucky enough to NOT get Jo Ann. Jo Ann over hears that the rooms are ready and responds \\\"Thank God!\\\". How unprofessional can one person be? I say nothing, get my key, and go. End of Jo Ann\\n\\n\\nFast forward to my arrival home...\\n\\nI check out and head home on 7\/1. While checking my email on 7\/3 I notice an alert from my credit card company. Turns out there are $498.13 of fraudulent on-line charges on my credit card. I've had this card for about 4 years with no issues whatsoever so that struck me as odd. Now I'm not saying that this happen at the Tropicana or even that an employee of the Tropicana is to blame. But, I do find it highly coincidental that this happen. The last two times I've used that card were to book my room with the reservations department and to check in at the hotel.\\n\\nThere were several pluses about this hotel but the minuses have overshadowed them for me. I will continue to stay at hotels that meet my standard of service( Caesar's, Plant Hollywood, Wynn, etc..) and steer clear of the \\\"New\\\" Tropicana."}

Me and my family recently moved and this is the closest location to us. I will never eat here again! The service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress skipped over us, our food took over an hour with the excuse that gluten free entrees take longer. Yea well not at any of the other locations.

I ordered from  the \\\"Small Bits Menu\\\" because I wanted a light lunch - believe me - it definitely was \\\"Small Bits\\\",  good thing they gave out bread because I needed a second helping of that just to let me know that I ate something!  My suggestion is to order from the dinner menu if you want a full meal - of course most folks are much more sophisticated than this old country boy and can figure out what most of the fancy California stuff is on the menu - sorry!"}
{"label":2,"text":"The owners of Honey Salt & now Made LV have what it takes to be successful, staple local restaurateurs... & I'm not even one of their fanatics. I dig the decor & energy of Made LV but hate the entrance\/host area. Our waiter (Dave?) was one of the best waiters I've ever had- personable without overstepping & had personality. As weird as it is to criticize this, I did not like their glasses! Too short, too wide, too heavy... requires more refills, which was the one place where our service was lacking. Plus, the only straw that fits is a cocktail straw. Talking to others, prior to going to Made LV, & once we reviewed the menu ourselves, we agreed that it's a bit disappointing that there isn't more of a traditional bar\/comfort food menu (with or without their spin on the items). We found it challenging to decide what to eat & wound up getting the same thing: pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was a good size- bigger than a slider, smaller than a burger- & plump with the pulled pork. The bun was also able to withstand the sauce of the filling but still soft. The pork was cooked well with a nice balance of flavor & a kick. The sandwich came with homestyle sweet pickles- after the sweetness of the sweet potato fries & the pork, the pickles were too much. A dill would have been a better offset. The fries were very good & cooked perfectly. Being a fan of Honey Salt's desserts, I wish I'd had room in my belly to try MLV's mini donuts or s'mores nachos. Fast forward a couple hours... I glanced around & noticed the place had pretty much cleared out so I said \\\"it's probably almost time to close, we should probably get outta here.\\\" A random employee was walking by & overheard then told us not to worry & to stay & enjoy ourselves. We only stayed a tad longer then headed out... outside, we looked at the time & the restaurant had indeed already closed. The fact that there was no hinting by staff to get the heck out speaks volumes about their service. It's the kind of service that'll take me back to a place with terrible glasses & limited menu options, any day, over a place with multiple appealing items & lackluster service."}

{"label":1,"text":"During our three night stay the first night was pleasant but it went downhill from there.  We are owners at the timeshare where this bar is located in and overall I was disappointed. It's a nice bar with decent food but we are definitely skeptical about the ethics of the staff. No where on the menu or anywhere else do they let you know that gratuity is included in your bill until you're paying the tab. On your final bill they are supposed to stamp in red ink so that you can see the gratuity was included. My friend's bill did not have that stamp and I was distracted and did not see it on mine and we both paid double gratuity. On the third day my husband was playing the poker game at the bar and wanted to cash out. The bartender is the cashier for the machines. The bartender thought my husband was too drunk to notice that he shorted him $40.  A stranger gaming next my husband was nice enough to jump in and back my husband up.

Honestly, I feel like stores like Sports Authority are going to be going the way of the dodo soon because their prices are MUCH higher than online retailers. Rarely a sale item will be on par with Amazon.com or other online stores. But, I figured I would stop in anyway to see what they had available in windbreakers. \\n\\nThe result? Not much. And everything was priced at MSRP retail to boot. Of course, I mean look at the size of the store. Look at all those employees talking to each other instead of their customers, and look at the cashier playing with her iPhone instead of looking for people to assist. That's quite the payroll to make every week. \\n\\nAnyway, I was in there for 20 minutes, got asked if I needed help zero times, got no glance or assistance in the shoe section, and got no \\\"have a nice day\\\" from the cashier texting and looking down as me and another customer walked out.

Not bad.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like:\\n\\nThe pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for \\\"personal\\\" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.\\n\\nThe service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.\\n\\nWe gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back."}

The aroma inside was not as pleasing as the Chinese supermarket down the road, but still a large selection of things on offer.  There's a large Polish population in Edinburgh, and they will be well served by what Deli Polonia has to offer.\\n\\nThere's also now a cafe side to the business, since it's been recently extended in the past few months.

{"label":2,"text":"I should not have gone to U-Swirl this last weekend for many reasons.  I had just eaten a large breakfast maybe an hour earlier.  I don't care much for frozen yogurt.  There are better things to spend ones money on.  But the fact remains that I was hot and needed something cold while waiting in the area for an appointment one hour away.  So I went in and saw they had a strawberry yogurt and NY Cheese Cake yogurt next to each other.  I got a small bit of both swirled in the smallest bowl I could find.  I topped it with a few strawberries and some Golden Graham cereal.  $2 and change later I was sitting down relaxing and eating my fro-yo.  It was OK but not mind blowing.  The first bit of yogurt that came out of the machine was watery and a bit off putting.  The NY Cheese Cake tasted more like coconut than cheese cake.  Both yogurts had icy chunks that I did not much like biting into.  It reminded me of my grandma's homemade ice cream but it was rather unlike the creamy frozen yogurt that I know I've had elsewhere.  Finally, why is there a tip jar in a self-serve establishment?  I tip for service provided not for people who have already taken money from me without providing a noticeable service in return."}

Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it.  My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!"}
{"label":1,"text":"The concept is a great. A restaurant\/bar inside Whole Foods. I love Whole Foods, but not Twenty Highland Tavern. \\n\\nWe were here Sunday evening watching football. What goes well with football? Pizza. Well, they ran out of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese AND basil pesto. The only cheese they had for pizza was feta and cheddar jack. How does a restaurant\/bar that is located inside a grocery store run out of anything?!?!?!\\n\\nOn top of being annoyed that they didn't have the necessary ingredients for a basic pizza, our waitress was an airhead.

What is a barstaurant pray tell? In my limited experience, a place with dance club like atmosphere but it also serves food. I used to go to ones in Chicago and sometimes they had the best food. We had the bu dae jigae, commonly known as G.I. stew. Why would anyone want a spicy stew that has spam, ramen noodles, sausage and rice cakes? Cause it's awesome and spicy and you will want to eat it. You can also get some decent duk bok gi which are spicy fat rice noodles with fish cakes. It was a little sweet for my taste but definitely spicy. Panchans were sparse but not a problem since we ordered tons of food.\\n\\nWe had the lychee & soju drink, which was a good compliment to all the spiciness going on.

A gentlemen walked in wearing designer clothes and the staff was more than happy to greet and assist him. Apparently, I didn't look like a serious buyer so the staff didn't give me the time of day.

{"label":1,"text":"We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night. \\n\\nThe place looked very promising with its modern indoor\/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable. \\n\\nDuring our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options. \\n\\nWith pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes. \\n\\nThe pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps. \\n\\nThe flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries. \\n\\nA bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh. \\n\\nBy the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed. \\n\\nMaybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer. \\n\\nOn the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room. \\n\\nNormally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something."}
{"label":4,"text":"Just when I thought Bad Daddy's (previously Big Daddy's) couldn't get any more amazing they slightly revamp the menu and add the BAD ASS BURGER.

Add a fried egg to this and its easily one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. I mean, there's fried bacon on it and ground bacon in the burger patty! Epic, its an epic burger. \\nAdd to that killer tots, awesome fried pickles, more great burgers, $2 PBR tall boys all the time, great service...I could go on and on. \\nThere's a chef's special burger that changes daily.

I ordered the Rising Sun, which was a teriyaki burger with avocado and I think fried onions. It was pretty good, but I didn't get a \\\"burgasm.\\\" I liked the shoestring fries. I only ate about half the burger, which was reasonably sized but still not worth 20 bucks. Shakes are around $13 but looked pretty good.

{"label":1,"text":"While on a trip to Vegas to experience some great food and good atmosphere, Union was a huge disappointment.\\n\\nAfter trying a different (and amazingly wonderful) restaurant in Aria the night before, we opted to give Union a shot since they had a seemingly good prix fixe menu for $49. I ordered the Roasted Tomato Soup, the Organic Chicken and the 7 Layer Chocolate Cake for dessert; my partner opted for the King Crab and Jalapeno Taco, the Chilean Sea Bass and the Apple Pie for dessert. We also chose to add the wine pairing for $20 as well.\\n\\nWhen you go to a show, you don't expect it to peak in the first act - and that's what happened at Union. The appetizers were by far the best aspect of the whole experience, but given that it was tomato soup and tacos, it's not hard to screw those things up. For the entree round, my chicken was a tad overcooked and borderline rubbery. The garlic spinach that came with it was great, as was the tablespoon of parsnip puree that accompanied it. The sea bass was equally rubbery and overcooked, and a delicious sounding risotto that came with the sea bass was slightly undercooked and on the starchy side. The desserts were just OK - nothing special. My cake was on the dry side, but the apple pie was not bad. \\n\\nI have to echo what others have said about the service. It's abysmal. The guy serving water was the hardest working person on the crew. After we ordered, we barely saw our waiter. It was a revolving door of people coming by (which is not unusual), but our waiter rarely checked on us. He dropped our wine off in the same manner as a delivery person dropping off a package. I was surprised that a wine pairing didn't come with dessert, especially after seeing other places in Aria (and other resorts) offering a pairing with each course. Had we known that, we probably would have ordered a bottle instead, but the waiter didn't take the time to explain that. We found out after our dessert was delivered.\\n\\nWhile we were there, we noticed two groups get seated and subsequently leave without being served. There was plenty of staff, so I'm not sure what the problem was. They all seemed in a constant state of chaos. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is not bad. If you want something quiet and peaceful, this is probably not the place, since it overlooks a big bank of slot machines that constantly sing. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely not recommend this to anyone going to Vegas for a culinary treat. There are plenty of better options within Aria, and there are several other places nearby to get a much better steak (if that's what you're looking for). Save your money (and your time) and treat yourself somewhere else."}

But locals and returning customers would go to Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil, or Fogo di Chao, or even Sambas at the Mirage.\\nIt's just sad to see a business run down in service, quaility and even the decore.

So when friends of mine who i consider to have serious culinary tastes started to rave about this new buffet in Vegas' Cosmopoliton resort, I had to be skeptical.\\n\\nI mean, c'mon, can any buffet really be that good?\\n\\nSo on my recent trip to Vegas I went with a large group for dinner and with all the hype, I went in with a pretty open mind.  Yes the entrance and decor is flashy and fancy as fitting for the new flagship casino\/resort on the Vegas strip.  Ok cool, but what about the food?\\n\\nIt only took me a few minutes of browsing the buffet aisles to realize what the noise was all about.  While some dishes are still served in large 'serve yourself' dishes and pans, the majority of the buffet items are presented in a tapas, small-plates style.  Everything from the salad bar, to seafood, to asian dishes were presented in individual dishes and tins which one, looks better and two, encourages portion control so you can avoid overloading on one dish and finding yourself running out of space for others.  I was like a kid in a Toys R us store at christmas holding a blank check given by my parents.  Basically I was paralyzed with endless choice and didn't know where to start.\\n\\nSome highlights:\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese station - Like an omelette station, you pick your noodles, cheese and fillings and the cook will make your own custom style mac & cheese with results for better or worse and I tried a swiss-gruyere combo with vegetables thrown in for color.\\n\\nCarvery - aside from the usual roast chicken and prime rib, they also had roast lamb and *gasp* beef bone marrow!  \\n\\nDessert - full gelato bar and and array of colorful and cool looking premade desserts.\\n\\nBest of all, this buffet ran $40 for dinner, no more expensive than any of the other top level buffets on the vegas strip.  $12 all-you-can-eat sirloin dinner at the Golden Nugget this is not, but I wouldn't even compare the two.\\n\\nI may or may not be back depending how much I want to punish my stomach again."}

From the crisp, delicious baguette and butter provided to start our meal, to the onion soup, pate, roasted brie with honey and hazelnuts, and my open-face salmon \/ egg salad sandwich, everything was delicious. The frites, probably cut on a mandoline, were really crisp, a perfect fry.

If this place is in the top ten restaurants in Vegas as advertised, they should shut the town down and quit. Pitiful just pitiful, and the side of asparagus was much better.  If you want a complete dinner, skip this joint!"}

{"label":2,"text":"This hotel was nice, our room was beautiful, but somehow I still felt a bit unsatisfied staying here.\\n\\nThe pros: the marvelously comfortable bed, the spacious room, the nice flatscreen TV.\\n\\nThe hotel and casino were both beautiful.\\n\\nThe cons: the food options in this hotel were disappointing and we chose not to eat there over the span of our 5-day trip. The only coffee option is Starbucks. The hotel is not nearly as cool, fun, or activity-filled as other hotels (such as the Bellagio with its water show or the Caesars with it's Chinese New Year garden and shops). THE HOTEL CHARGES A $20 RESORT FEE, WHICH PURPORTEDLY IS FOR THE WI-FI AND SOME OTHER NONSENSE. Oh, and you no coffee maker in the room, obviously so that you'll go spend money on coffee downstairs at Starbucks. \\n\\nAdditionally, the free wi-fi internet was spotty and slow, the concierge and front desk failed to pick up our phone calls on more than one occasion and we had a RIDICULOUSLY long walk to and from our room on check-in and check-out days. \\n\\n***A quick Vegas note, it's painfully obvious to me that most casinos are designed to be islands of their own, so massive as to make visitors get lost in them and be reluctant to leave. MGM was actually less guilty of this than the Caesars or Bellagio."}

{"label":3,"text":"So I'm writing another update.  This has become one of my favorite local restaurants.  I told my daughter she could pick a restaurant for dinner and she picked El Ranchero.  We were just there 2 days ago!  Tonight I talked with the owner, Elias a little.  Very nice guy.\\n\\nI tried something different-Chili Rellenos.  It was a whole roasted poblano pepper filled with a blend of 4 cheeses, dipped in an egg batter and cooked, then smothered in a light and flavorful tomato and onion based sauce.  Awesome!  It was somewhat similar to an omelet and Elias said they could make it for breakfast if I wanted to come by any morning.  \\n\\nI think updates are limited to 5.  Before long I will be able to write a review of each and every menu item.  So far I've only tried about 6 different things.  My daughter had tamales for like the third trip to El Ranchero in a row..."}
{"label":2,"text":"I reserved 3 nights at the hotel for a Monday through Thursday getaway.\\nI bought vouchers through TravelZoo giving me a 240$ suite at 100$ a night!\\nThe vouchers, I thought, had a massage included in them and 20$ daily credits intended for drinks at the pool.\\nWhen I arrived, the check-in process was pretty fast except for the fact that I had to make sure I check-in every day of my stay because I bought 3 different vouchers (not that there was another option available anyhow). We were 3 people. We entered the suite and it was just as we saw on the virtual tour we took before reserving. Satisfactory. There was a large bed, a two-piece sofa, 2 flat screen TV's (which were never turned-on), 2 stereo system for iOS devices (I had an Android device :\/ ) and a huge glass-covered bathroom with a stand-up shower and a bathtub.\\nThe reason for giving the hotel 3 stars is not necessarily because of bad experiences, it's because of the timing of the reservation.\\nI saw a lot of potential for the pool parties, which we were not in good timing for. The casino was not very young and the restaurant down at the lobby is not worth eating at.\\nA positive is although the hotel is off the strip, there is a free shuttle leaving the hotel every hour towards the strip. The club in the hotel is supposedly good, but we never had a chance to party there."}
{"label":2,"text":"We came here for breakfast before the long drive back home. I ordered the Eggs Benedict.

Eggs, bacon and potatoes are easy, and he loves them.\\n\\nBoth of my sons ordered the bacon and eggs for breakfast, and both asked to substitute the 3 pancakes for the potatoes.  She said SURE!  Guess what?  Not only was the serving of potatoes huge (they could have easily split one - a really good waitress would have suggested this) - but it was a $3 UPCHARGE for each order of potatoes!  Because potatoes are SO MUCH MORE expensive than pancakes?  WHAT?  Ridiculous!  AND - we weren't told about the upcharge!  Since a stack of 6 pancakes is $6, and potatoes are $3, I assumed this would be a wash.  It was not.  Insane!  The eggs were fine - but all of the bacon was completely overdone - crispy and border-line burnt.\\n\\nMy Dutch Baby was stellar, I loved it.  It normally comes with strawberries, but they are out of season (and I understand this) and I was offered bacon.  Not only was the bacon overdone, I was charged $6 for it.  \\n\\nBreakfast for me, and for 2 little boys, totaled $49.98.  Besides my Dutch Baby, the food was mediocre, at best.  And the best?

I really was not impressed with hash house, I ordered their bacon, avacado, and swiss scramble along with crispy potatoes and a bisquit. The eggs were really runny and not appetizing, I love eggs and I was severely disappointed by this, the best part of them was the bacon mixed in, but even then it was overpowered by the eggy, soggy mass (needless to say, I didn't finish them) the potatoes were ok, but not memorable, the best part of the breakfast was the biscuit wich was very good, it was light on the inside with a crisp crust and had a hint of rosemary in it, delicious! i didn't need butter or jam with it. The other problem with hash house was the portions, they give you way too much on one trough sized plate, it's intimidating to see when it comes out, it makes you feel that every meal was an eating competition of it's own, no wonder man vs. food went there. Next time Adam Richman says to eat somewhere, do your own investigation and skip this place and go to Bobby Flay's MESA for their awesome brunch."}
{"label":1,"text":"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.  My first visit resulted in about a 1.5 hour wait and the order was incorrect, so the final wait time was close to 2 hours.  My second visit on 08\/19\/12 was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.\\n\\nThis is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \\\"who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\\\".\\n\\nI'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review."}
{"label":3,"text":"I wanted to try this when I was here last year, but I had to wait a year.  Like many similar spots throughout the different casinos this is a frozen drink and bottled beer stand that serves blended slush like drinks in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.  This one is located just outside of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino's Street of Dreams next to the Starbucks at the foot of the escalators leading visitors to the Aria\/Crystals\/Bellagio free tram.  The location is in a bad spot hidden from view from visitors exiting the Street of Dreams shops.  There is bar seating and small round tables nearby as the Monte Carlo website depicts (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=HWH4uputadH926t3vAqz6A).\\n\\nMy friends walked over to Starbucks for some after-dinner coffee, but since I don't drink coffee I decided to have an alcoholic slushie instead.  Of the eight or so blended concoctions I went with the 16 ounce Blue Ice (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=w-MIlrBEGwq3Sh1GUL7g9g) made with SKYY Citron Vodka partly because I'm attracted to blue colored drinks like blue Gatorade, blue PowerAde, Blue Raspberry Slurpees from 7-11 or blue cream soda.  The vodka taste stood out quite well and with the exception of a few spells of brain freeze I enjoyed the drink very much.\\n\\nThe flavor was neither too sweet nor too tart.  It was a very good smurfy blue after-dinner refresher.  The $8 price for a 16 ounce serving was exactly the same as all the other similar frozen alcohol blender stands we saw at other casinos along the Strip.  Jello shots are also available but not every night."}

My favorite we the mushroom and sweet potato pizza and the Mac & Cheese with corn in it.  \\n\\nOur waitress was awesome.

When there is a long line at the window, the staff run out to the cars beyond and take orders so when you get to the window, your drinks are ready. It's definitely an indulgement to get a specialty coffee as they are a little pricey (except for $3 happy-hour), but I allow myself one every couple of weeks. The loyalty card is great so you can earn stamps toward a free coffee of your choice. I absolutely prefer Dutch Brothers to Starbucks any day of the week!"}
{"label":3,"text":"We stayed for three nights and were pleased with the room overall, but disappointed with the bathroom.  The door did not close completely, and there was only one outlet - which did not work 2 out of 3 nights.  The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and they have done some nice renovations on the rooms, but neglected to use the same care to update the bathrooms.  \\n\\nWe likely will choose a different hotel on the Strip near the Bellagio on our next visit, but would consider staying there again if some changes are made to the rooms themselves.  The casino and restaurants are wonderful (Prime is the BEST steakhouse on the Strip!!), but the guest accommodations themselves need a little TLC.  Cheers!"}

Also had to ask repeatedly for mustard and sesame seeds, again, these are usually staples that just come with the meal where we are from. We had the kung pao chicken and a combination dinner (#3). The food arrived immediately which made me wonder about the freshness, but overall the food was good and we will go back."}

{"label":0,"text":"I was out with my family searching for a nice Italian meal but didn't want to drive all the way to Maggiano's.  Now whenever I visit an off strip restaurant I have two criteria that they must meet to achieve 3 or more stars:\\n1. It is equal to or better than Sizzler \\n2. The service is decent enough where I don't have to wait more than 5 minutes at a time for my server to return with a refill etc.\\n\\nFists off my 4 year old wanted saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms instead of a meat ball on his kids spaghetti, the server said she couldn't do it and it would be a $3 up charge. I could imagine that mushrooms were cheaper than meat until I tried the mealy, grainy, over worked, flavorless turd that they put on his plate. \\n\\nI had the hot wings which were clearly fried from frozen considering the menu says it takes at least 15 minutes for them to arrive and I know how long it takes to cook chicken.  They weren't bad and the sauce was decent with out too much vinegar. My 5 year old had the kids chicken parmesan which was surprisingly large but lacked flavor. The same with cavatelli meat sauce my girl friend had.  I am shocked by how little basic seasoning they use. I think the only salt in the entire restaurant is on the table. There was none in the pasta water none in the sauce and certainly none when the meat was cooking.  Honestly I could make better Italian food on a camp stove.  \\n\\nI think the bottom line is I am so sick of being let down by Italian. I hate signing my fifty dollar check and thinking to myself how I could have gone to fazoli's if I wanted a shitty meal. \\n\\nThanks for nothing Giuseppe's,"}
{"label":1,"text":"Having been to a few other McCormick and Schmick's, I thought my husband and I would give this one a try pre-Symphony. Getting a reservation for a snowy, Friday night was easy-peasy and they sat us even though we were 10 minutes late. \\n\\nThe drinks were fantastic. I had a Lemon Drop, and like the M&S in Kansas City, it was the best Lemon Drop I've had. We also ordered a raw tuna appetizer that was just delicious. Unfortunately, that's almost where the glowing review ends.\\n\\nI just want to say that the service was very good. Our server was attentive and kept our order rolling to ensure that we were on time for our curtain.\\n\\nI had the seared scallops with saut\\u00e9ed spinach and red pepper white cheddar mash and my husband had the sirloin with broccoli and ordered a side of oven-roasted mushrooms.  The mash in my meal was cold, not ice cold but not even lukewarm and the potato chunks were under cooked. My husband's mushrooms were cold, actually cold and his broccoli crown (whole, not cut up) was literally raw. They hadn't even cut off the end of the stalk that starts to turn brown when it's getting old.\\n\\nWe both chose 1 glass of wine each and the wine-by-the-glass menu is not extensive. Neither of our choices were great. Luckily, the manager comped our wines since most of our food was cold.\\n\\nFor a higher priced restaurant such as McCormick & Schmick's I do not expect and will not accept such poorly prepared food not once, twice, but especially not three times in one meal. We will NOT be returning."}

{"label":2,"text":"Definitely a different vibe and scenery from your other typical Downtown LV Fremont Street establishment.  Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.\\n\\nThe abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.\\n\\nSo I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's \\\"temporary relocation away from Las Vegas\\\" party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.\\n\\nJust like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.\\n\\n[Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]\\n\\nSummer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.\\n\\nCuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.\\n\\nI also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.  \\n\\nSweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.\\n\\nThe Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.\\n\\nOverall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.\\n\\nIf you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.\\n\\n3 stars!\\n\\nReview #10 of 2014"}

I'm definitely no longer a fan.  The food is good, but it's not not THAT good.  Heck, even Panda Express does better now!  Lost a customer with their cheapness."}
{"label":0,"text":"I wish I could say something different than most of the other comments but alas I cannot. The service was the worst I have had in some time. We waited ten minutes for two glasses of sangria, when that finally arrived the waiter took our order (some couples combo that included an appetizer). The the size of my drink was quite small so I finished it rather quickly and waited for our server to have another ten minute personal conversation with the table next to ours meanwhile we were still waiting for our breadsticks and salad... After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out. Back out as in from the heat lamp. One bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm. Needless to say after a small chat with the manager explaining how I would not return due to poor food and even worse service we left without being charged. In the end, save your time, save your money, and do not eat here, there are much better establishments in champaign."}

I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.\\n\\nSo, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w\/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. \\n\\nOh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled. \\n\\nWhile I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable.

{"label":0,"text":"Ok so I was in need of some quick cash & this place was only 15 minutes away from work. So I loaded up a suit case & an extra bag of unwanted or barely used items & went there right after work. First impressions are everything & this place was not impressionable at all. It smelled of stail cigaret & old clothing. The employees working there did not fit working in that place. Or maybe they did, very snobby, blank face, acted above it all. \\\"Um... Please ladies, take a look around you?\\\" Strange considering this place looked worse than a thrift store. I still thought for sure I would make at least $20-$40 bucks. HaAh! Yeah right! I had a Calvin Klein sweater & vest in great condition just no longer my size, a neat Obama sequined tee, several pairs of cutsie earings, & a only worn twice beaded sandals. Not to mention a few misc. items that were great for everyday use. I just didn't need these items because I have so much already. The girl was very pleasant, took out my items one by one &  examined them, but had a blank face expression. After all this she only wanted to buy an old ruggedly leather belt for $4.98. NOT $5.00! Only $4.98! I chuckled, said fine, only to cover the gas expense it cost me to go out of my way.  Not sure what they're looking for because I saw some of the stuff they had on the wrack. It all looked old. & the clerk called my stuff old. MY STUFF WAS FAIRLY NEW & in great condition! For some reason I felt embarrassed. I walked out feeling as though I had a tail & it was tucked very far between my legs. Needless to say I went straight to good will & donated the rest of my stuff. Of course the shoes I'll just give to my mother.

The manager walked by many times and never stopped to ask us how we were even though a dish came out late and then wrong in addition to that.

Nor did I expect them to place us in an area undergoing construction! We should have at least gotten a discount for putting up with that!\\n\\nPlus, when we checked in, there was a HUGE line that took forever to get through. \\n\\nOur room amenities were limited to a very small bottle of lotion, a miniscule amount of shampoo+conditioner in one, and one lego-sized cube of soap.

Plus, the bath drain would get clogged and fill up during a shower. \\n\\nThe hotel itself had tons of entertainment opportunities, such as the adventuredome, casino, arcade, carnival-area, and pool. \\nBut the staff in the carnival area were rude, and one even told us we weren't allowed to sit in the lounge chairs. Like, wtf?!? Then what are the effing chairs for?!?\\nFurthermore, the pool is only open from 9 AM to 5 PM, so you can't use the hot tub at night. We were tempted to sneak into another hotel's pool area because we missed the cutoff - but we didn't.\\nAlso, you have to pay for internet here, which is the pits. I can deal with 2 or even 5 dollars a day, but it's $11-something here! That's ridiculous! I brought my laptop, but we didn't end up using it at all because of that insane price.\\n\\nThe hotel will advertise that it's on a prime part of the strip, but actually it's on the very South edge. Non-in-shape people, like myself, will probably have to pay for other modes of transportation to get to the REAL prime points farther down the strip.\\n\\nOn the good side, our bathroom was pretty large, and the hair dryer actually worked. \\nAlso, the buffet here is rockin', in my opinion. And I love love love the crazy decorations and lights surrounding the outside.\\nThere's also a free, but very minimal, circus show that starts at 11 AM everyday. However, from what I could tell, it was only a few acrobat routines and that was it.\\nOn the morning we checked out, there was this really funny clown paid to pretend to be really sleepy in the lobby. I posted a couple pictures - I thought that was a riot. Definitely a great comedic addition.\\n\\nAnyway, I could have paid a quarter of the price at that gross Travel Suites neighboring Circus Circus, and not have gotten even half the hassles we had to deal with here. I also heard Luxor had been doing a $70 dollars a night deal, which I should have gone for considering they're so much more elegant of a hotel.\\n\\nWell, I lived and learned. Circus Circus is not worth it. Though I know it could have been a lot worse."}

Hostess was welcoming. Table server was friendly. Recommend the appetizer tower and the HUGE Double Barrel Burger.  \\nHowever, after dinner we decided to stop by the bar and there was a girl and guy bartender. The girl was nice, blond, smiled at everyone. Unfortunately, we sat on the blond guy's section, he only waited on girls that came by and joked around with his bartender coworker. When we asked for a drink it seemed like it was a drag for him to take our order. Who's hired at this place?

{"label":4,"text":"This hidden gem of a brewery is a welcomed edition to the expanding Downtown district of Las Vegas.  Located next to the Heart Attack Grill on Fremont Street, this unassuming brewpub is a welcoming local spot to stop by for some amazing brews paired with some truly incredible gourmet popcorn (I love the Dill Pickle flavor).  Before you get yourself too involved with this review...you should know that Banger Brewing is a beer-only zone.  A craft brewery.  A beer bar.  Not a watering hole hammering out fruity cocktails and pouring pre-chilled shots from Jaggermeister mini-fridges.  If you're looking to drink tequila out of a stranger's belly button or drag along your 21 year old girlfriend who only drinks amaretto sours and raspberry kamikazes then this most likely isn't the place for you.  That being said...the beer is good.  Real good.  All 7 of their beers are brewed on site including options ranging from the smoothly unpretentious  American Pale Ale, \\\"Perfect Ten\\\" (ABV 6.2%) to the rich, coffee and caramel laden \\\"Simply Stout\\\" (ABV 6.0%).  My personal favorite is the Sandia Watermelon Wheat (ABV 5.1%).  The happy and helpful bartender assured me it's mixed with fresh watermelon to give it that crisp, clean and in-no-way-fake watermelon flavor.  The Jalapeno Hefeweizen is equally as impressive though I found myself worrying over how \\\"user friendly\\\" this beer is to the general public.  I was shocked to hear some mixed disapproval from my beer tasting comrades.  Apparently jalapeno beer is an acquired taste like black coffee, kombucha or moldy cheese.  But what I love most about this place, aside from their top notch craft beers brewed on site, is their exceptional customer service.  Coming from a hospitality background, my radar for these sorts of things is uncontainable and even on high alert and in search of any pinprick of poor performance or inattentiveness; in the 3 hours I spent at this establishment I experienced only perfection.  The staff is professional, knowledgeable, friendly and most importantly, in love with their beer.  Smack dab in the middle of Fremont Street in the notoriously lackluster yet rocketing Downtown district of fabulous Las Vegas, Banger Brewing doesn't scream out its arrival but proudly just says, \\\"Hey, Vegas.  Here I am.  I hope you like my beer.\\\"  This place welcomes you in with a smile, an ice cold glass and a great brew to fill it.  It's like walking in to your corner neighborhood bar only with way better beer and even better service."}
{"label":3,"text":"My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.  I think it helped make the wedding reception more pleasurable as we had already had an opportunity to meet.  Angela made it so easy to arrange."}

{"label":2,"text":"A Goodwill with no clothing?  What are they doing with all the clothes I donate?  Sending them to a less desirable location in Phoenix?  Only in Scottsdale.

The problem is if she buys 100 items for $1 each, and sells 2 of them for $5, she's made a profit in her mind.  Anywho, on her recent visit she insisted we visit a variety of thrift stores and garage sales.  This was our first stop.\\n\\nUpon walking in, I noticed it smelled like potpourri.  Maybe it was because they don't sell clothing, but in any case, potpourri beats the smell of a moth ball or old people.  Before I noticed the way this Goodwill is marketed, I was  astonished at some of the furniture.  Why it looked hardly used.  Because it wasn't.  There is some used furniture, however, and you'll know it when you see it.  There was a ton of other household\/kitchen items.  Not a bad place to get that kind of stuff as some was pretty reasonably priced.  Also, we went on a Saturday and found they offer half off of anything with a date over so many days old, so that's a bonus I guess.  I didn't buy anything, but my mom did.

I had the order amount in my head based on the prices on the website menu. When I questioned the total to the cashier, she printed out the prices. I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense. I replied that I thought they should charge me the prices from the website menu. She just gave me my change and didn't even say thank you (I guess the attitude started). I asked to speak with the manager, but she said he wasn't there. If it were my restaurant, I would have gladly matched the prices that were on the website menu, no questions asked or attitude given.

Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!\\n\\nOn the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...\\n\\nTwo years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).\\n\\nInstead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \\\"well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\\\" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...\\n\\nI left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.\\n\\nSo this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.\\n\\nSo I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be.

I understand that people may have more than one business transaction so that's no problem but they need to staff more tellers when the line is out the door. This is outrageous. \\n\\nThe customer service varies from day to day depending on who I get. Some of girls are snooty as all hell and act like it's a problem that they have to do their job.

This is also a place I trust and will not try to add extra unnecessary work to up the cost. I needed my whole AC unit replaced in my car. Fortunately Dan was willing to change it out for me. I still needed to take my car and get the AC vacuumed and charged. Since it was late in the evening Friday afternoon, I asked if I could just drop it off and pick it up the next day. They had my car ready pretty early Saturday! Best part is they did a great job on charging my AC! It runs so cold! I am no longer melting. I will for sure bring my car back, see y'all in a few months for inspection!"}

I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place."}

This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least - we had an awful seafood tower - the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act."}
{"label":1,"text":"My husband  and I ate here last night with 5 other people, a first trip to this restaurant for all of us, prior to attending an event at Heinz Hall.  Unfortunately, our experience was not good, mostly because of very slow, uneven and unprofessional service.  Our server told us she was new and she was friendly and tried hard, but our appetizers and dinners all arrived at different times, as much as 30 minutes after ordering for one of us, whose appetizer never came until the rest of us were almost finished with the entrees.  Even the soups for 2 of us arrived late, and you'd think this wasn't an item requiring much last minute effort in the kitchen.  Most of us thought the food was fairly good, but my petite fillet was very tough-I would be surprised if it actually was a fillet cut of beef.  At about $60 a couple with only one beer or wine apiece, and primarily appetizers with no desserts,  this  was not good value, and the service was about as bad as I've ever experienced.  We all felt sorry for the over-worked and undertrained new server."}

After being seated for 15 minutes and having at least 5 different servers all make eye contact with us as they were tending to people who had been seated after us, my husband, daughter and I walked out.\\n\\nThe second time we went, the service was only marginally better.  The server was okay, but only good enough to get a \\\"c\\\" grade.  Never once did she or anyone else even ask how our food was once delivered.  She made it seem like we were an unwanted obligation.  \\n\\nI will say that the food is truly amazing.  The green chile pork is wonderful and the have the best mimosas I've ever drank.  There are so many items in the menu that I'm excited to try but only if the level of service improves--it definitely sets a negative tone for the entire meal.\\n\\nCan good food be ruined by bad service? Without a doubt!!! I will give this place one last shot and hope that the third time I a charm."}

Ever since Li'l Ceasars made a return to the area, but they've gone downhill in the quality department....either that or I was really just a dumb teenager who didn't know any better. (Hey, Godfathers was great back in the day, too!...I think.) Cici's isn't \\\"pizza\\\" like Taco Bell isn't \\\"Mexican\\\", so don't even bring that up. It's just garbage. Donato's is okay, just pricey.\\n\\nThere are better pizzas to be found in the area, but this review is for \\\"chain restaurant\\\" pizza and Hungy Howie's is probably the best. It reminds me of the pizza Little Ceasars made back in the day. It's fast, it's cheap, and it's pretty damn tasty. It's gotta be the crust...the garlic-butter crust. I've tried their other flavored crusts but this one can't be beat. This is one of the only chain joint that knows how to properly cook their pepperoni. The edges of the pepperoni get that little bit of char around the rim. Deeelicious!\\n\\nYour pal,\\nWalter"}

First thing I got was prime rib, decent but not seasoned like it was at Paris buffet. One thing I enjoyed was the noodle soup bar. You can order udon, pho, Tom yum noodle soup and some others. I tried the udon which I heard was the best and it was. The Tom yum soup was good but they gave the super thin rice noodle which was slightly powdery. A good variety of food and there were crab legs and shrimp. The crab stuffed sole was delicious. Dessert bar was decent. About the same items as the other buffets, with the chocolate shell tarts (but these had fruit) and coconut cream pie. All in all, not a bad buffet but not as great as I had hoped. I liked the Paris buffet and planet Hollywood much better."}

So for me, the atmosphere works, or at least on a lazy afternoon it does! Service was friendly and informative on the local brews on which I typically imbibe.\\nThe fries were well-cooked and not too greasy - Although, it did seem small for the price. It's not a deal-breaker for me because I don't need too many fries to begin with.\\n\\nI'll be back, maybe during late night to see how much of a party school ASU really is - I'll put my New Orleans-trained liver up to the test."}

Location is under construction so some businesses are closed and parts of the parking lot are a bit of a disaster, recommend using the garage.\\n\\nDespite the brand-name stores (Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Ann Taylor, etc), the mall itself is on the run-down side and not in the best area of town, either. Expect to run into a lot of foreign shoppers who are nearly rabid and salivating over the sale prices, with no courtesy- cutting you off, snatching up things you're looking at, etc. If you don't want to deal with that, maybe go elsewhere.\\n\\nLots of sales here, being that it's an outlet but definitely make sure you're getting a good deal before buying- many of the locations have minimal markdowns, while others have 20 on top of 50% deals regularly.

{"label":2,"text":"Hungry and exhausted from a day of touring the city, my boyfriend and I stumbled from the nearest Bixi station into this New York Times-recommended French bistro. We had a 10:00pm reservation (the earliest slot available on Opentable that summer Saturday) and were eternally grateful when they could seat us at 9:30pm. To our surprise, the restaurant was far from packed, although outdoor seating was mostly taken.\\n\\nThe food was really good. We didn't order any entrees; Instead, we got the charcuteries platter (good to share between two people), which included duck rillettes (divine with caramelized onion), foie gras terrine, cured ham, and pork saucisson. Some of the charcuteries were only ok, but some were amazing too... The foie gras rivaled the pate at NYC's Bar Boulud. Additionally, we ordered two corns on the cob (light, simple, delicious with butter and salt\/pepper) and a side of fries (very tasty). Our meal ended up being approx $70 with a glass of beer.\\n\\nAs far as French bistro cuisine goes, Brasserie T definietely succeeded in the charcuterie. However, there are little things about the ambiance and service that threw our experience off.\\n\\n- First, we were seated at a table with no tabletop candle or overhead light. It was so dim that we couldn't read our menus. We requested a table change and got moved to a window table that had a harsh overhead white light (compared to the soft yellow lighting other tables got). Slightly annoyed but too embarrassed to request another table change, we stayed put. But it elicited grumbles from my boyfriend.\\n- Second, it took foreeeeeever to flag our server down for the check. It was as if she forgot about us after our orders were put in.\\n\\nBased on the hype (from the Toque connection and NYT review) and menu prices, I had certain expectation about the restaurant as an overall experience. Brasserie T tried to meet those expectations, but it fell just short. Certainly not bad but certainly not amazing."}

We chose a garlic herb oil  to compliment the vinegar. Garlic yumm!  If you are curious about any of the flavors you can test each and everyone of them. The bottles are about $21.00 each. \\n\\nThey also sell nozzles, bottles and bowls that you can purchase for your oils and vinegar. I purchased this cruet that held both oil and vinegar.

I started a new diet and exercise routine and my eating has to be pretty strict in the beginning.

I was running out of my meal replacement which is a hard to find one because it's all natural, high protein, low carb, tastes great and no artificial flavors. \\n\\nAlso it has superior quality protein. So anyway, let me preface this by saying I HATE chocolate anything. Hate is probably even an understatement. I just cannot eat or drink anything chocolate flavored. So I always order vanilla meal replacement. Well I opened my shipment from Vitacost yesterday and what was in the box instead of the vanilla that I ordered? You guessed it.....chocolate. I gag. I gag. I called and they sent a replacement so I'm awaiting the correct flavor. \\n\\nI order all of the time and this was the first time I received an incorrect order.

This is something you just have to try in order to understand how delicious it really is. \\n\\nDessert was almost certainly out of the question until the server started to describe them.

The ice cream itself was really cold, and on the first full week of autumn weather in this unusual Las Vegas weather, it definitely chilled me to the core.

Flavor-wise, I'll just say that I enjoyed the cookies 'n cream a lot more than the chocolate brownie nut (\\\"c'mon Chris, you don't even like chocolate ice cream...\\\" \\\"yeah, but the other flavors didn't sound all that special either!\\\" \\\"well, you should try the vanilla some time because you never seem to do that.\\\" \\\"ok, ok, fine then\\\").\\n\\nFat Daddy's is probably a more suitable treat for summer months.

Last time we were in my husband could not remember which Amber beer he had the last time we were there. The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive.

It also doesn't hurt that they have sandwiches and boxed lunches for those days I forget\/don't have time to make lunch for myself in the morning.  Yea, those are on the expensive side, but they are infinitely better than school lunches.\\n\\n\\nOn top of handling the morning rush like pros, they are also life savers.

I know that sounds excessive, but some were prizes for students during a huge review game and others were just some extras I like to keep on me for emergency gifts.  Well, in the all of the commotion of morning, after I purchased the gift cards, I walked out and left them on the counter.  The wonderful people working there knew I'd be back so they put it in the safe and when I called 30 minutes later they said not to worry and that I could pick them up any time.

I was let down by the menu to begin with, since one of the best parts of Belgian fries is the sauces, but for the most part their selections are very ordinary: plain ketchup, BBQ, hot sauce, etc. Between my friends and I, we ordered burgers\/sliders (which were just decent), fries, a number of different sauces so we'd have variety despite the options being quite ordinary, and were delivered a completely different selection of sauces than what we had ordered. I called Sliders to request that they deliver the correct sauces and they delivered a bag *with our order correctly handwritten on it* yet with another seemingly random collection of incorrect sauces inside! We gave up. The fries were bland and oily anyway and bore little resemblance to authentic Belgian fries I've eaten in the past.\\n\\nThe second time, I tried to give Sliders another chance by ordering a burger and a slider -- since the burger had been the only decent component of my meal the first time -- and it was awful. The bottom of the burger was not only sort of charred, but absurdly, horribly salty. I *love* salt but I found this barely edible. A burger this bad from a cheap burger place wouldn't be as disappointing, but this was $5 to start plus they charge you extra for cheese and some other toppings (including the jalapenos, which were not very good jalapenos -- all heat, no flavor). The slider was a little better but nothing special, and seemed more like a tiny burger than a proper slider anyway. Overall, too much money for really lousy food."}

The free-range chicken was delicious as well, a tad too much cheese inside but the taste more than made up for it.\\nTotally recommend going."}
{"label":1,"text":"Was expensive even with \\\"half off.\\\" Had a lot of beers, first two picks were out though. Bartender seemed rushed to finish with me. If you're looking to try hundreds of beer on tap this is the place for you, just make sure to bring a lot of money."}
{"label":0,"text":"Is this the cheapest rental place in Phoenix? Yes. Will they nit pick you with add on fees? Yes\\nJust returned from a 3 day trip to AZ, so here is my review. Counter- no wait, I had everything filled out online prior to my arrival. But the woman behind the counter was almost trying to bully me into taking their insurance coverage. Even after I told her I had two policies that cover rental. \\nThe car was ok. Hyundai elantra with 31K but overall good shape.\\nThe RETURN: Stopped at gas station less then 3 miles away and topped off the tank. Kept receipt and showed the person checking the car in. Asked for a copy of the return and they said it would be emailed . So to my surprise, I was billed for 2 gallons of gas \\\"refueling\\\".  It was topped off so I'm assuming this is a regular trick they play to add cost. \\n\\nWhen I do this again, I will pay a little more to have a better experience."}
{"label":4,"text":"Great Place! The food was like a fine restaurant in Taos! I had the Taos Combo Honey Smoked Pork Tamale, Tenderloin Relleno & Shrimp Enchilada for 16.95. Awesome! Rustic and tasty! They server was very good! We went to the Roaring Fork the night before and the food was not that good and cost 2 times more than B\/A and I was treated to an undercooked piece of chicken! :oP Go if you have the chance! Don't forget the Sopapillas! We had 10 people and the service was great.\\n As for the one star ratings. You can't drop a single star rating an then say the food is great. To me 90% of a rating is the food. Scottsdale location was Awesome as well! went there 2 nights in a row. Places have off nights it happens. If you say the food was great but you will never go again seems like your a bit high maintenance. Get over it!"}
{"label":2,"text":"This place is your typical Italian restaurant with good food and an only ok dining area. The tables and chairs could use replacing and the decor is outdated. The service was a bit slow but not horrible. The food was average and they prices were a little high. I have also ordered in their pizza and it came quick but for the cost, it was not what I expected. I have been to better Italian places in town so this place will only be one I go back to because it is close to my house."}
{"label":3,"text":"Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I've been visiting over the course of the last few years. The menu has changed over the years with a lot of new options provided. My favorite is the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size but still retains its grandness but what can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants? \\n\\nTheir chicken is solid, so is their chicken tenders. I think I ordered their chicken burger once as well and it was solid. All in all, good grub, for a chain.\\n\\nHowever, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and probably are less healthy than the fries.\\n\\nThey have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P\\n\\nThe Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.\\n\\nService is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.\\n\\nAll in all, a nice place to eat at, if you select things you know are good."}

This place is amazing if you like the later part. The venue is cool when it is not packed and fun with a group of friends. Don't get me wrong many people love this place, I just think there are other clubs with more room to dance in, yes I actually do dance, game recognize game. The hip hop room is ALWAYS crackin if you love hip hop. But more packed than tuna in a can and it is a sauna in there. Cliff notes: Go there if you haven't before, other than that move on."}

Just some 'low life who can't afford a phone' fault. :( Anyway this is definitely a hot spot! Check it out!!!"}
{"label":3,"text":"We came here with some friends who love this place. We're not huge huge sweet people, but I enjoyed trying it. I love the variety of flavors they have on their menu. In the last month and a half, we've been there about 2 times and have only tried 2. (Again, neither I nor my husband can really finish a whole popsicle.) \\n\\nThe first time we tried the limon - it's kinda like key lime pie. With half of it having the really really tart lemon taste and the other half made of graham crackers. My husband likes the tartness, but for me it was too much. I liked the \\\"crust\\\" part. \\n\\nThe second time we came we tried the limon amarillo. That was very good. Very refreshing. It's not too tart. Has a good balance of sweet and tart. That's been my favorite so far. \\n\\nWe've always come late in the evening and it's pretty chill there. There's not a lot of seating, but has always been sufficient for the groups that we've gone with. \\n\\nI also like that they have free water with lime, lemon, or orange in it. \\n\\nWhen the weather warms up again, I'll look forward to trying some other flavors. \\n\\nAlso, I think the groupon deals are helpful. I'm not sure if I would come that often if I were just paying regular price. But we'll see what comes when it gets warmer!"}

{"label":1,"text":"Took my parents to Brazz this Saturday for lunch for my dad's birthday. To be honest, I was a little concerned after reading the reviews.  But I was determined to give it a try and be fair with the place.  We arrived at 12:30ish and there wasn't a soul in sight.  I hope they have more patrons during the week.  The place is a little hidden in The Green area, next to Fuel Pizza.\\n\\nWe were greeted and sat immediately.  They have a lunch buffet offering during the day for $11.95 a person. It comes with the salad bar and 3 meat carving station.  The salad bar was ok.  The few salad that have actual leafy veggies looked a little soggy (ex. Caesar salad, management may want to leave the dressing out and let the customer put on when served).  Crab salad was the only \\\"seafood\\\" option but I don't eat imitation crab.  Tuna and chicken salad can be filling. I wish they have smoked salmon.  The carpaccio looks a little scary... The meat was orange with a mustardy sauce on it, I can't tell if it's beef or not.  The soup was chicken vegetables and it was a bit high on sodium.\\n\\nOk, on to the meat.  Top sirloin was well seasoned.  The meat was a bit tough but it is sirloin after all.  Once you get to the middle cut then it is definitely medium rare.  The pork loin was 2nd best.  A little bland in the middle.  I like my pork medium well to make sure it isn't overlooked, so this was not bad for a cook through porkloin. Turkey was the worst.  No seasoning, bland and dry. And the turkey gravy was thick with a jelly, yellowish color and consistency.  But it was needed to give the meat a taste.\\n\\nThe hot side bar has the best overall offering. Sweet potato casserole was good. Roasted veggies and potatoes both were good.  Skip the garlic mashed tater. And there was only one dessert looking item and yike, it looked as appetizing as it tasted. \\n\\nThe service was good, but we were the only table.  I also can't blame them for hanging out by the bar upfront since there's not much to do even though it made them look slacking. \\n\\nConclusion: to be fair, this is not a 1-star place. It is likely a 2 to 3 stars depending on personal taste and expectation.  I can see how it may be more of a disappointment during expensive dinner time. And while I was getting worried about the food quality (some of the reviews were down right scary), I am glad to say I was feeling fine after I ate :). And darnit I didn't see or get any cheese rolls."}
{"label":0,"text":"What a disaster for lunch.  Arrived at 12:20 for lunch with a party of 11 and when we got there we were the ONLY people on the whole restaurant.  This was a business lunch and a big party so you would think the place would pay attention to us. WRONG.  The waiter was a slow as molasses and once seated it took 10 minutes for him to bring us menus and take our drink orders. Again remember we were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!.   Finally after 20 minutes we order and our drinks some 35 minutes after we sat down.  Meanwhile the waiter and another guy were wiping tables and moving stuff on the patio. Who knows why, no one else was in the place.   After over 1 hour we get our food and several orders were wrong.  He does not apologize and challenges the person saying they changed the order and he brought the correct order.   Finally after over 2 hours we finished and it still took 10 minutes for the server to bring the bill.  No wonder this place was empty. Absolutely horrible service avoid this place like the plague. I will be sure to share this horrible with every possible person to let them know what. Horrible service, inconsiderate wait staff seems to be acceptable for this place. unless you have lots of time to sit and wait avoid this establishment.  Can i give them ZERO stars???

We didn't really know what to expect, so we dug our heels in for a night of randomness...and they did not disappoint! The outside just looks like a regular liquor store, if you drove past it you wouldn't even notice it. But once you walk through the doors, the alcohol heavens open up and little drunken angels start singing 'If you want it, we got it! la la la la la!!!' I was amazed at the selection and had barely been there 30 seconds when I noticed the sign directing us downstairs to the cellar and pub area...and even more choices!!! Every microbrew, macrobrew, and everything in between that you have ever (or never) heard of is down there. We opted for the $5 wine tasting to start...and didn't regret a second of it! There were (I think) 6 types ranging from riesling to shiraz. Each one better than the last. Then we purchased several other bottles of delicious wines, including a very strange cabernet sauvignon named 'Giani'. It is a chillable red wine that is EXTREEEEEEEEEEEMELY sweet. Not in the way that people say 'Oh this red wine isn't as dry as this other one' NO! It was actually sweeter than grandma's coffee. So if you are someone who thinks you don't like red wine because it's not sweet, try this stuff, it will make you a believer."}

Very disappointed in Michael's management skills in regards to training staff to treat customers with respect at all times.

My ticket was supposed to be at will call. Well none of the employees knew where will call was. They asked me the how much I paid for my ticket and boom... I was in. Anyone could have just walked in. We walk in and this place is SMALL. The pool is about 3x the size of the pool in my backyard. If you're used to going to other pool parties like Rehab at Hard Rock, this place doesn't even compare. Only positive thing about the venue is that the stage is pretty big and you get a great view from anywhere.\\n\\nWe head to the bar for some drinks. They only have one bar with really rude understaffed bartenders. Paid nearly $50 for a vodka redbull... WTF... Later on when I needed some water I was told it was $9 for a tiny bottle of water!! How the hell do you have a pool party out in the vegas heat and have the nerve to charge $9 for water???  If thats not robbery I don't know what is. They refuse to give u any tap water too.\\n\\nThat was not the worse part. We came to see Skrillex and Alvin Risk for a night time event which was advertised from 530-midnight. After skrillex finished his set around 9, they started kicking everyone out of the pool and essentially killed the club. The music stopped playing by 930 and they started kicking everyone out.

The lobster was definitely frozen and the imitation crab stuffing was awful. The raw oysters didn't have any flavor and the leg of lamb was dry. I do have to admit the prime rib was good as was the lobster bisque. However it still wasn't worth the $49.99 price. I've had better, for instance, Wynn and Bellagio.

And a lot of the stores were more gimmick stores.  One of the stores was a sock store, which reminds me of the one at CityWalk.

{"label":2,"text":"A lively, modern space, DLUX impresses when it comes to ambiance.  The large 4-sided bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, literally. Semi-circle booths and small rectangular tables line three of the walls, leaving a small front area open for a happy hour crowd standing and mingling. \\n\\nDLUX was running a 15min wait at 7pm on a Tuesday, not surprising given how few tables there actually are when it gets down to it; the place is not as big as it appears from the outside.  I liked the decor and lighting, it pulses with urban energy.  Purse hooks tucked under the bar are always a nice touch, as is validated parking at one of the nearby ramps (be sure to refer to the website to make sure you park in the right one!)  \\n\\nThe menu is primarily burgers, with a few salads (all of which included meat, although I'm sure you could ask for it without, but then you're paying for protein you're not getting, but I digress...) Plenty of vegetarian options with the burgers, as they allow a free substitution to a portabella on any of their tasty concoctions. There is also a Portabella Caprese burger on the menu along with a White Bean burger, which was excellent.  The size of the burger was good for me, but probably a tad small for a strapping lad who may want to opt for the upgrade to a double (+$3). No sides come with these burgers (all $8) so if you want fries with that plan on +$2.  I'm fine with that, I don't need\/want a pound of fries with my dinner anyways!\\n\\nThe burgers and ambiance were a solid 4*, it was the service that was a bummer.  I was surprised, given the very friendly and cheerful host staff and all the positive accolades on the service listed here.  Hopefully our experience was just a fluke.\\n\\nThe trouble began when we ordered an appetizer to start (spinach dip) and then burgers & beer.  The beers came... then the burgers... THEN the appetizer (Marissa's pet peeve #92 - they call it a \\\"starter\\\" for a reason, folks, if it was supposed to come after you got your dinner it would be called \\\"dessert\\\").  \\n\\nNow, I understand that kitchen crews sometimes make things out of order or a server puts in a whole order at once instead of staggering their entries... BUT this is server 101 - when poor timing happens you either:\\na) correct it with the kitchen staff before it even gets to the table or \\nb) apologize to the table for things being out of order and figure out a way to remedy it.  \\n\\nEither of these can help negate pet peeve #92.  However, when neither of those things happen and the server brings the burgers and then returns with the appetizer, without a word of acknowledgement that things are out of order or an apology, well, I'd like to introduce you to Marissa's pet peeve #107.  Either:\\n a) the server will hope I don't notice that my \\\"starter\\\" just became my \\\"ender\\\" or \\nb) she doesn't care or \\nc) she doesn't know any better.  \\n\\nHmm.  I've got a problem with any of those options. All that being said, I liked the energy and ambiance of the place and my burger was good.  I'd give DLUX another shot but I know whose section I'd avoid.  Wink wink."}

I went at about 10:00 and they had a line of five people, with two stylists.  They said it would be about 20 minutes.  It was actually about an hour.

An old lady came in unhappy with her cut, and they got her in right then.  (No waiting in line for re-do's, apparently.)  The stylist was very sweet with her and fixed it for free.  I kind of wish I had known they fix bad haircuts, but then again, there's not much you can do when your hair's so short it looks bald.  Eh.  It grows out, right?"}

Charged for deliveries I didnt ask for, charged for all of the mistake they couldn't get right. NONE of my phone calls seemed to register, or be noted or recorded anywhere..EVER. In my first month of service I called the company 15 times. Finally, after realizing they were utterly incompetent, not to be trusted, and after i called to cancel, i was charged auto debited for what was to be the last month, i called back and requested my debit card be removed from their system. I said i didn't trust them to get the billing right. Smart deal - i get a $39 dollar bill in the mail for erroneous deliveries i never asked for, and asked them to pick up. Every single charge due to their own mistakes. Not only are the people working for this company incompetent, they are dishonest liars.

{"label":1,"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place. If I were to base the rating solely on the all glorious Volcano Roll...this place would get 5 stars. Unfortunately I have to consider other things that detract from the love of one roll. I have been going to this place for years. My family from the east coast always request to go here when they are in town (which maybe more of a fascination with the AYCE thing.) I ate here a few weeks ago and was very sadly disappointed. The hubby and I sat at the sushi bar. The place wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination yet the orders we placed took an insanely long time to prepare. We ordered Cajun albacore, hamachi, a volcano roll and a Todd roll. We also ordered shrimp tempura from the kitchen and calamari. We quickly got edemame and started to devour it. We then got our tempura orders. This whole time I am watching the sushi chef that took my order...chopping something for another dish, or to stock they're bar, or whatever. We waited 20 minutes for the Cajun albacore!!!! In the meantime another couple came in and ordered a roll. The same sushi chef that took my order...made a Philly roll and gave it to them....I just glared at him thinking when are you gonna make my sushi rolls???? My hubby (very mild-mannered and timid) was begging me not to say something. Then (under my constant glare) the sushi chef made our hamachi and the other 2 rolls. It took 30 minutes to get this little amount!!!!! Aside from that. I actually had to get out of my seat and go over to the waitress (talking to the other waitress) to get me a drink refill (much to the chagrin of my hubby.) I was never asked for a refill on any of the tempura orders ( which are included in the AYCE menu.) \\n\\nI honestly believe that they stall making your sushi so that you will: \\nA) get pissed off and leave! \\nB) get full quicker since you are eating slower, and therefore you eat less. \\nC) run out of the 45 minute time limit and not be able to order anymore. \\n\\nThis used to be such a good place, and such friendly people. I don't know if a new owner shook up the place or what...but it breaks my heart to say that I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon."}

The bed was great at first, but the mattress has deep indentations now from where we sleep.  We contacted Mattress Firm and they had us come in and fill out paperwork that they then faxed in to their warranty department.  I was told that I should be getting a call back sometime in the next 2-4 weeks.  After 4 weeks, no call back.  I called my local store up and they said the guy I filled the paperwork with had been transferred to another store.  For some reason, I had to track that guy down because they never keep copies of the paperwork so the rest of the people at my local store where I filled the paperwork out at have no idea what had been done with me.  Anyway, I tracked the guy down and he called up the warranty department.  Turns out they never actually got the paperwork.  So I brought my copy of the paperwork back to my local store and had them fax it in...again.  They got a confirmation receipt that the pages were sent and received.  This guy tells me it should only be 3 days before I hear back and had no idea why I had waited a month to check up on it.  (SIGH!)  So 4 days go by and I still don't get a call from the warranty people.  I call up the warranty people myself since I'm tired of dealing with the local store.  They check up and discover that they did in fact get my paperwork, but that something went wrong when it faxed over (guessing it's a problem with my local store's fax machine) and the pages are illegible.  I asked why they didn't tell my local store that it didn't send properly so they could resend it.  Apparently, the warranty department receives faxes but they can't actually tell which store is sending in the fax, so they didn't know which store to contact to get the information resent.  Grrr.  I finally just scanned the paperwork from my home and e-mailed it, then called the warranty to make sure that they got it and that they could actually read it.  They did.  only it was on the weekend, so I have to wait 3 days from Monday before they call me back.  Somebody please shoot me now."}

I ordered the vegetarian roll and miso soup. \\n\\nMy friend said that the California roll was basic, nothing too surprising there. But the pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi were HUGE! Although he didn't really like the tuna, he said that it had a weird texture like maybe it wasn't fresh. The eel was his favorite out of the nigiri. \\n\\nThe miso soup was very flavorful, I also really liked the ginger dressing on the salad. The vegetarian roll was a bit small, made up of carrot, avocado, cucumber and bean sprouts. Not the best vegetable roll I've ever had (especially for $7.50), although the avocado was very creamy. \\n\\nOverall, compared to other Japanese places\/sushi bars in restaurants on the strip, Mizuya is definitely on the more affordable side (If you can call $50 for everything we got affordable). Their sushi is good, you can be lucky or unlucky with the sashimi and the soup is EXCELLENT. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some decent sushi at a decent price."}

Knowing that Burger Bar is a Hubert Keller restaurant, I went in expecting a lot...maybe expecting too much.\\n\\nYou basically build your own burger here.  There are so many choices.  You get to pick your meat, bun and your toppings.  I went with the Black  Angus Beef Burger with bacon, grilled onions, sprouts and bleu cheese( http:\/\/static1.px.yelp.com\/bphoto\/DUT55eQDtMPNZgyjN_JvKg\/l ).  I swear the restaurant wasn't very busy, but the food took for-e-ver to come out, and we were huuuungry!  After watching food pass us by to other tables, our food finally came.\\n\\nFor a $14 burger(after all my toppings), I was expecting to have a super orgasmic experience when biting into my burger.  The burger was good, but definitely not the best burger I've ever had.  The meat was nice and juicy, but  the flavor didn't wow me.  \\n\\nAgain, service was sloooooow.  We were done with our meal, and we wanted to pay our bill so we could head to the airport.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found.  We finally get our bill and want to pay it, but again, the waitress disappeared.  Maybe I was just more irritable because I was tired and hungover.

{"label":4,"text":"I want to permanently live at my new favorite stay-cation destination!!! \\n\\nAt checkin, I was asked which room location I would like (all of which came with a balcony!)  - my choices included - pool view, lagoon view, quiet buildings, those located near the party area - so many choices! I was in heaven!! We chose a room overlooking the lagoon - semi close to the pool, but far enough away to have zero noise. At night, there's a fire fountain in the middle of the lagoon that was so wonderful to watch while sitting on the balcony sipping lemon drops and having deep talks.\\n\\nThe amenities were FANTASTIC! There are two water slides that kept us busy w\/ the 5YO for hours. There are nice size gates around the pool area and it felt very safe and clean. The adult lounge area was very sleek and beautiful. Next time, we will bring friends so we can hang here and leave the kids with a babysitter at night!  All of the grounds were wonderfully lush and landscaped nicely. I never saw one piece of garbage on the ground anywhere.\\n\\nThe room was lovely - beautiful decor, great materials, no detail was compromised and the place was perfectly clean. Even with the loud fire fountain outside and the ice machine outside our room, our room was completely quiet inside - it was a great experience.\\n\\nWe bought our room with miles, but given the amazing rates, I think we will have to have one more weekend here. \\n\\nHere's a link to the great summer rates.\\nhttp:\/\/www.fairmont.com\/scottsdale\/HotelPackages\/SpecialOffer\/SummerSale.htm\\n\\nI would recommend bringing your own booze - we bought two boat drinks by the pool for a little under $30 including tip. Thank goodness we had our own mixers in our room for the rest of the stay!\\n\\nHighly Highly Highly Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"label":1,"text":"I hope you don't think that I'm too critical by the end of this review. \\n\\nBut honestly I've been to better dive bars. The first thing that struck me was the location. Crap! It shares a wall the the Trunk Space, on a corner of Grand Ave and 7th ave I believe. Getting there, maneuvering the strange sharp turns, and then locating a parking spot definitely downs my drinking enthusiasm.  -1 for initial placement. Although, if you happen to be catching a show at the Trunk Space, this place is 5 steps away. \\n\\nWhen I first entered the place, I admit I was impressed with the interior decor. The whole tiki-style theme was nice and consistent. Except for all the stuff behind the bar. I mean a piece of paper with a note written with a marker saying \\\"We have the right to refuse anyone service\\\", just screams \\\"low class establishment here\\\" to me. At least the air conditioning and lighting were comforting.\\n\\nThe service was decent. The lack of crowd allowed my party and I the utmost dedicated attention. I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon, which if you have a three person group, the price is pretty good. You get three smaller than usual frosted glasses which I liked. However, as a fan of Blue Moon, I was unimpressed by how bland the white ale tasted!! I'm sure it was flat. It was cold though. Ill give them that.\\n\\nOverall, I would come back again, but only if I happen to be at the Trunk Space. I see no reason to deliberately make this place my destination.\\n\\nBy the way this place is Cash Only......"}

{"label":2,"text":"This experience was definitely A-OK. Not fantastic, not bad, just fine. I wasn't expecting much since this is not a full-facility spa, so my expectations were not too high. My boyfriend and I got the couples' massage, both of us did deep tissue. \\n\\nThe storefront was a little hard to find, which it shouldn't be because it faces the freeway. The little strip mall it is in feels a little dodgy. Definitely not somewhere I would want to be at night by myself. \\n\\nThe decor is pretty kitschy in an attempt at old vegas style, but it's nice enough. The girl at the front desk was nice and they had a little waiting room off to the side away from the lobby area. They have some small bottled waters and teas. Points for trying! \\n\\nThe massage itself was alright. My masseur had good technique and did a really good job of concentrating on my problem areas, but one issue I had was his hairy arms! I've had male massage therapists and have never noticed this to be a problem. Perhaps the massage lotion (not oil) that they use doesn't soften his hair as much as oil at other spas does or something. I have very soft \/ smooth Asian skin, and either his arm hair was very stubbly or very coarse, but every time he used his forearms on my back it felt like I was being massaged with sandpaper. Ick! Also, since the couples' massage room is on the street side of the building, we could hear the music coming in from the waiting room pus the sound of cars zooming down the freeway the entire time. \\n\\nWhen we were finished and I went to put my clothes back on, I discovered a big glob of massage lotion still on my back. I wish this had been wiped off better. The facility does have a shower and towels, but I think this might only be offered to people who get all-day treatments such as a massage, then a facial, then something else, etc. I didn't see any robes, so I'm not really sure how you're supposed to traipse down the hall to the bathroom\/shower room anyway. I suppose I could have asked about the shower, but I am meek like that and had already put my clothes back on anyway. But if they aren't going to offer the use of their shower facility, they should do a better job of wiping the massage lotion off. \\n\\nIn all, everything was alright. I feel like I could get the same quality of service \/ lack of amenities for half the price at massage envy, though. I was hoping this would be a step up since they charge more (nice candles, fruit-infused water, etc), but really don't expect anything more than the massage itself."}
{"label":0,"text":"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \\\"CEO doesn't like us to do that\\\". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."}

{"label":3,"text":"Not gonna lie, I don't dream about dining in veg-only restaurants often, or ever, but with a lunch date with my vegetarian sister on the books, I figured it was a good enough reason to try the place... I have to say I was very impressed.\\n\\nWe chose to sit outside and it was quite nice. The handful of iron chairs and wood-top tables scattered on wooden flooring made you forget you were yards from central avenue, until a train would come through. Lots of plant life, and they had a few heaters set up. We opted for the cucumber infused water (there were other bottled options) and started on the menu. We were give one which was simply drinks, the front half is freshly made juices and juice blends (all $6 - we opted for a lemonade\/agave concoction) the back is beers and wines. \\n\\nThe food menu is the perfect length - just enough small plates, sandwiches, salads and entrees, with lots of daily changes (bruschetta, soup of the day, buddha bowl, cheese selections). They also have the items which are vegan or can be made vegan marked with little ferns, which I thought was clever. We couldn't pick, so we decided to split four of the small plates (but the table next to us had the OM burger and it looked amazing).\\n\\nSquash blossom hush puppies - yummm. thank you kenny r. for the heads up. I wouldn't have known it was vegan cheese if it hadn't said so on the menu. So good, I didn't want to share. I enjoyed the onion \\\"butter\\\", my sister did not, luckily these pups stand perfectly well on their own.\\n\\nThe Indian Tacos - this, as a meat lover, was hands down my favorite dish. If I hadn't know any better I would have sworn up and down with the complex flavors they brought into the chili that I was eating something heartier than beans and squash. Mixed in with the lettuce and tomato and then sandwiched between a layer of the sharp cheddar on top and fried goodness underneath, holy crap, I'm sold. \\n\\nThe Envious Artichoke is the perfect light dish, stuffed with spinach and olives and topped with fried onions- we were very happy campers. On the other hand, the cannelloni added some serious weight to my stomach. Granted, it's a great fall flavor concoction of goat cheese goodness served over a sweet squash puree - but not the greatest choice for our fourth tasting dish. \\n\\nOur service was top notch- water constantly filled, staff was very familiar with the menu, we were checked on just the right amount of times. Even though there isn't any meat on your menu, Fern, I'm a fan. (but seriously, get some new pens.)"}

{"label":3,"text":"Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!\\n\\nWhat you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!\\n\\nThe food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!\\n\\nCoffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well. \\n\\nWe used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board.

Now I'm not sure if she meant we don't have those as in we are out right now or we don't make those.  Now I ordered the 3 strawberry shortcake and 3 banana cream - which I have had in the past, so as I looked at her confused and at their display, she said well, let me check. She walked in the back and said it would be one hour!!  I couldn't fathom as to why the people in front of me, who also ordered specialty doughnuts, would be only 15min and my order would be one hour.  As I was already there I decided to wait.  I ordered a coffee and saw they had vanilla - empty (now the same guy that ignored me is right there and says nothing), so I just get regular coffee.  Another lady tried the vanilla and yup still empty. This time the guy says \\\"oh I have more in the back let me get it - it'll be about 15min\\\".

I agree with all the other reviews that the 10 minutes or so segment of his career was very self absorbent on his part. Ok we get it. You're a famous magician.\\n\\n\\nI would not put it past him if the audience chosen to be part of the magic tricks were planted. Everything just seem fake and super cheesy!"}

{"label":3,"text":"What a great place!  I've been going here for the past year about twice per week.  The facility is always clean and the staff is friendly.  The concept of this theater is nothing but fun. They have a bar located in the lobby with seating if you choose to have a drink while waiting for friends. You can take your drink with you in the movie if you do not finish it.  There are \\\"2\\\" theater types. Fork N Screen permits children where \\\"Cinema Suites\\\" only permits 21 and over. Both serve the same food & drink menu. The Fork N Screen has more seating but the seats do not recline where the Cinema Suites are far more private and the seats recline. I love the little red help buttons next to each seat if you need service, hit the button and voila... they show up! The food is average, the apps are pretty good, and the drinks are fun. There are really good restaurants located in the Esplande if you choose to have dinner elsewhere and then see a movie.  They also validate for parking for 4 hours!  Overall, this is a great spot for a night alone, date night, girls night, or a family afternoon. AMC also has a stubs program ($12.00 year) I use it to earn points and free dollars to use."}

{"label":0,"text":"The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  \\n\\nOkay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.\\n\\nOnce again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it?!?\\n\\nThe Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The \\\"sour\\\" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.\\n\\nThe egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  \\\"My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!\\\"  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  \\n\\nThe Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!\\n\\nService was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.\\n\\nIt pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he\/she wishes this place was closer so he\/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  \\n\\nI rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.  In this case, I left food on the plate and almost shouted \\\"no\\\" too enthusiastically when I was asked if I needed a box to take the remainder home.  Oh God in Heaven:  NO!!!!!"}

Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.\\n\\nWe both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as \\\"the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as \\\"Vegas' biggest.\\\"  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.\\n\\nThe bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it back and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!\\n\\nI only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.\\n\\nWe both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.  \\n\\nService was great.

Most recently, I am the Matron of Honor in a friends wedding and we purchased the bridesmaid dress here. \\n\\nFirst off, when choosing the size for my dress, the girls measured me and told me to order a size six.

Considering I don't usually get these kind of alterations I decide to get it done at the store because I figured they were the experts - WRONG choice.\\n\\nI make an appointment, which is hard to do on the limited schedule the alterations lady works.  I settle on a Friday in the middle of the day, causing me to have to leave work early.  Turns out the lady shows up 20 minutes late.  Then, when I picked up the dress she blew off my appointment assuming the dress will fit... well it didn't (again I left work early for the appointment).  Then, the lady says she can come back in an hour to fix it... I go home - 20 minutes later she is there and I have to rush back to the store to get the dress fixed.  There is more to the story, but I won't bore you.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the store owner offered me $35 dollars for my troubles... that's right $35 off of the $145 I paid for alterations--- BTW the dress cost me $120, so the alterations because I was convinced to order the wrong size cost more than the dress itself.  SO ANNOYED.\\n\\nI WON'T be back to this store.  I've bought so much here and now realize the lack of service is not worth my convince.  I promise I will be driving out of my way to get wedding related items in the future.\\n\\nP.S. They don't take American Express, which I find VERY annoying since it is the only credit card I carry."}

The mamey shake was a little bland, but never having had mamey before, I had to try it.  I assume that's the way mamey is, and it was soothing and cooling, so the bland wasn't a total negative.

I know, I know it's \\\"4-cheese\\\", but there is a delicate balance with cheese.  My friend ordered it another time and the balance was much better.  The second time I went I got the Veggie Rice Bowl.  Wonderful seasoning, but they overcooked the tofu.  We also ordered the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  No thanks.  My friend had the salmon - loved it.  My other friend got the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap separate times.  He liked both.

{"label":2,"text":"I was disappointed with my experience, but I'm willing to give it another shot.\\n\\nThe main problem was our waiter. We had very slow service. We were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus. I ordered coffee and half-and-half, but I didn't get a spoon or something to stir it with, which I thought was odd. I just kind of swished it around... It was weird.\\n\\nOur waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. \\n\\nWe also ordered pie. Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset. Their other waiter must have made that mistake. I went for the key lime pie which was delicious. The Fat Elvis was replaced with a drumstick (?) which I guess was good, but I don't like peanut butter. \\n\\nAnother thing is if you sit outside, they will give you plastic silverware. I didn't mind, but others in my party did. Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good, but the service was not. Andrew K attempted to show off his humor (\\\"Elvis has left the building\\\"), but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting. I'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside, but I feel he could have paid a bit more attention."}

I could have just that and a margarita and be set.  I ordered the chicken flautas with a side of guacamole.  The guacamole was simple (I hate when restaurants try to throw too much in there) and the flautas were crispy without being over done.  I drank a regular margarita and then I went ahead tried a coconut lime margarita since it sounded intriguing.  I was surprised at how good it was!  Not too sweet, but not bland either.

He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.\\n\\nWhen we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem. \\n\\nI will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around.

Yes, Joe, this one goes out to your pretentious ass.\\n\\nI went to XS for Tiesto night with three other girls after being promised by two different legit hosts that we would be able to get in on the reduced admission guest list ($20 for girls, $50 for guys). We were in line by 10 pm and did everything as we were told. When we got to the front of the line, however, Joe stopped us and told us there was no such thing as a reduced admission guest list. My friend and I whipped out our cell phones to show him the text messages we'd received literally minutes ago from our promoters, who were both working at Tryst that night. Joe basically told us he thought we were bullshitting (even though we told him he could check the numbers) and said he was only doing his job and we would have to pay $100 to get in (after telling our other friends $75 about 20 minutes earlier). Um... I'm sorry? I understand it's Tiesto night, but it's not even 11 pm, we're four girls on the guest list, and you're telling us to pay $100 to get into your club? We pointed out the absurdity of this and Joe told us in the rudest, most sarcastic tone ever that the only way he would accept proof of the \\\"reduced admission guest list\\\" we claimed existed was if we dragged one of our promoters over from Tryst to walk us in. We asked, very patiently, if we could go over and get a video recording or signature or something as proof. He said no and refused to offer a reason why, instead telling us over and over again to step out of line. \\n\\nBy this point we were tired of wasting time when he was just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole so we finally complied, but instead of leaving we went to go talk to Eric, who wrote us a slip within 10 seconds of us showing him our texts.

Service is always friendly, and wait is never too long usually. worth the wait if you have to wait though. Not a good place for parties of more than 4, more of a place for 2 ppl so you can do the bar if need be. \\n\\nBest thing is food always comes out quick and never disappointed.

{"label":2,"text":"Found this place for lunch through Yelp -- Thanks, Yelp!    I was a little nervous of what the restaurant was like by the loud almost club-like music being pumped into the parking lot, and it was a little loud in the restaurant itself, but I was happy when my chicken asada came on a heaping pile of very fresh local veggies, that were cooked nicely (still a bit crisp, not squishy and over done).  The chicken itself was still moist and sauce that came with the chicken was really yummy too.   \\n\\nI'd go back if I'm in the area again and looking for more upscale\/healthy Mexican.  One of my gripes with Mexican food is that it generally isn't laden with vegetables, so I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of the veggies that came with my dish. (baby carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions, and fresh sweet corn that I could tell was cut off of the cob - yay, that makes me happy!).  The salads that other diners were eating looked delish too, so if you like to eat fresh veggies, give this place a try."}

{"label":1,"text":"This has got to be one of the worst Wal-Mart's I have ever been to. My friend just moved to this neighborhood so we decided to go to this Wal-Mart so he could get some items for his new home. It was late, around 11:40PM. We needed to get some things from electronics but when we got to that department we realized they had it blocked off. We asked what was going on and they told us that their location now shuts down electronics at 11PM. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THIS IS WAL-MART! The point of having a 24 hour location is for convenience. They even had the makeup department shut down too. \\n\\nWhich brings me to why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of 1. I went up to an employee (SWEETEST MAN EVER!) and ask if he would let me go into the makeup department and get the face lotion that I had primary came to Wal-Mart for. This employee knew he shouldn't and even stated he wasn't suppose to, YET he still allowed me to go in there and get the lotion I came for. The fact that he risked getting in trouble to help me find what I needed blew my mind. That man deserves to work for a better company, a company that appreciates their employees that actually care about their customers. That's what I consider going the extra mile. HE DESERVES A RAISE! I wish I knew his name, all I know is that he was restocking the lotion when I approached him and he told me he just got back from vacation so he wasn't entirely certain why they had shut down those departments at 11PM.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and NEVER go to this Wal-Mart unless you want to talk to that AWESOME employee."}

The parking lot is usually full so it had me thinking they are doing something right.\\n\\nAnyways we get seated and take a look at the menu, we selected our choices and drinks. We were asked, \\\"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?\\\" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was \\\"Would you like a glass of water?\\\" They didn't say, \\\"Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah..\\\" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was, but I said that I didn't blame the server I blame management for trying to \\\"up sell\\\" in a round about way. The \\\"manager\\\" then tried to make good and take if off my bill, I just said, \\\"I don't care about the $5.50, I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place\\\". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern!\\n\\nPros:\\nFood wasn't horrible, but nothing outstanding about it.\\n\\nCons:\\nMy 1\/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1\/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty  was crumbly and was in 3 sections, all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos. \\n\\nWife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny, looked like 1\/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good, but the noodles had  what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.\\n\\nOverall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about.

{"label":2,"text":"went to F.A.M.E. specifically for this place and wasn't disappointed at all. only let down was that they only had vanilla filling. was advised that they usually have two flavors of fillings depending on how busy they get per day. they have vanilla,  green tea, hazelnut,  chocolate, and strawberry. I wouldn't mind giving green tea and hazelnut a go but not this time. I got the eclaire (chocolate dipped original) a coco and a cookie with vanilla filling. Lets start with the cookie. It  had bits of cookie all over the pastry and the cookie bit tasted good. it wasn't filled all the way and had almost 50% air inside the puff pastry and was a little let down. I read sok reviews that said it was filled with alot of filling so I was expecting the same. With that said all of the three cream puffs I got was filled the same and to me was not filled enough. the vanilla cream had a very light taste but it had a good consistency and good texture. the puff itself was made well and held the filling as it should. we then had the eclaire. it was go was go the chocolate added what seemed as a missing flavor if it had any and was a nice semisweet and not so much sugar it hurts your teeth chocolate. Then the coco puff. it was a coco puff with vanilla filling and I am glad I saved that one for last as it was the best one. the coco puff had great chcocolate flag and with the vanilla filling was a good combo. The workers were nice and greeted us and was very easy to talk to. Overall it is an ok cream puff, if I am in the area I would stop in to see if they have anymore flavors for the day besides vanilla but I dont think I'll be making a special trip just for these anything soon, unless they bring the sweet potatoes one here then ill be back lol!"}

Was not greeted by cashier. But what really upset me was the cleanliness of the exterior of the store for the curb appeal is horrible and it appears to be the only store in the entire shopping center whom doesn't clean up the piles of trash outside. If I was the owner and or property manager of the center, it would be a definite penalty for failing to keep the property clean. I also was inundated with flyers on my car windshield.

I guess it's the little things that make me happy. In all of my world travels that is one feature I have never really seen in a hotel. \\n\\nSteve Wynn spares no expense and everything is top notch in any of his properties. He understands his customers are willing to pay for the good life. Steve provides that good life here. He plays videos on the in-room TV where he describes the hotel. After 4 days of non-stop talking in the dry weather my voice starts to sound like Steve Wynn. I crack up all my co-workers with doing hilarious versions of Steve's TV speeches. I love Vegas for laughs with co-workers. \\n\\nThis hotel is amazing but expensive too. The room is great. It is so luxurious I want to stay here all of the time. The bathroom is huge too. I enjoy the amazing views of the mountains and it's such a great sight to see when I wake up. \\n\\nThe hotel has some restaurants inside. There is one we always go too but that's because you can get a bag of hot donuts after dinner. Those things are so good. There's also a nightclub but I've never been to it. Work seems to always get in the way of business trips. Damn work. \\n\\nI do use the gym\/spa though. It is a little expensive at $20 a day but I need to get my workout in. I will work in breakfast there too with some fresh fruit and a coffee. So it kind of works out because it might actually cost me $20 to just order that food for breakfast. My mornings are not complete until I've gotten my six mile run in.  So as unhealthy as Vegas can be between the amount of food and late nights this gym puts me right back on my healthy track. Which is derailed by the end of every evening...ha!!!\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas then this is the place to stay. It will make you feel like a king. I wish I could spend more time hanging here then actually working off-site. They use to have a free shuttle through the golf course to the convention center. That was the best but it's now gone. It made my work day so easy. Now I have to take the scary convention bus in traffic or a taxi to get to the show. Steve if your listening bring the bus back!!!"}

To make up for the lack of food they have nightly visits from different food trucks to serve up  some yummy food. I am pretty sure they also let you call for delivery as well.\\n\\nSo if you are looking to grab a beer without the hassle of the 8th Street location crowds or the trip to Scottsdale check out this little gem.

It's obvious that they are doing this since they don't seem to care about no one buying anything, even if it's the last day of the sale.The one bigger woman who works there is a complete snob about it too. You don't even want to negotiate with them because they are so rude. Oh! and don't say you love garage selling. Or Susie will rip you a new one since they consider themselves to be \\\"elite\\\" and not in the garage sale category. If you want to spend a hundred bucks on a crappy southwestern lamp you could get at goodwill for $5, then Susie's estate sale might be for you.

In retrospect, we should have went with something from the well-stocked beer list instead.  Both my wife and I ordered a vodka gimlet.  When it finally arrived (through no fault of the server, the bartender was just pfaffing around and talking to other drinkers while he should have been also making drinks), we were disappointed.

Lame, just lame.\\n\\nWe sat at one of the tables in the front of the house, the one's made from a barrel with a tabletop.  Comfortable enough, but it's pretty damned cold that close to the front window in the middle of winter (and I'm not easily chilled).

I had a lovely waitress who really went the extra mile to help describe the entrees and make sure I got what I wanted and not order too much food. She genuinely wanted me to be happy and was successful. \\nNext and even more important was the food itself which was outstanding. I had the triple tail special, it was perfectly prepared and delicious. The fish was  mild tasting, moist and flaky with a crisp crust. It was fresh as could be, delicately seasoned and served over seasonal vegetables that were cooked perfectly. \\nI did not have sushi or dessert so I can not comment on either, but I thought about my meal several times since then and wish this restaurant was in my home town. \\nI am sorry, but I had my meal at the other location. Otherwise this review is accurate!"}

(mind readers maybe??) \\nAnyways, this is not the \\\"Original Penguin\\\" that gained all the acclaim.

The biggest problem with this zoo is the ridiculous entrance fee.

There is a large amount of birds of many different species as well as the normal large cats and Savannah ungulates. Of course our favorite part was the reptile house, including a giant Galapagos Tortoise along with many other snakes and lizards. There is also a place where children can interact with sulcata tortoises. \\nThe aquarium is pretty nice. Its not the best I've ever been to, but also not the worst.

I will look again, but I did not see that noted anywhere on their website. Ok, so sushi is out...plan B. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with beef added and the mango, sticky rice with coconut milk for dessert. I paid extra for the beef, but didn't think about it until I ate the leftovers at home. NO BEEF!! What? Shrimp and brocolli with beef added...without the beef?\\n\\nThe soup was gross (I can not think of a better adjective). Neither of us ate it.

{"label":3,"text":"Pizzeria Bianco is an experience: it depends if it's going to be good or bad based on your attitude. \\n\\nI've eaten there twice, once in a group of three, the other time as a group of seven. I didn't mind the wait so much during the group of three (2.5 hours) because we found a comfy spot over at Bar Bianco (in the heat) and chatted away. The group of seven though was trying. A 4.5 hour wait that included an impatient 13-year-old, freezing temperatures, mud, and about eight bottles of wine for six people. Not a good idea. My sister eats at Pizzeria Bianco about once a month and knows the owners\/staff through business and didn't want to piss them off through complaining about the wait. You'd think we'd get better service or have a faster wait thanks to the connection, but it didn't happen. Make reservations if you have a party of 6 or over. It will save your sanity.\\n\\nI do have to say that the food is delicious once you trudge through the wait. My favorites are the Caprese salad and the Wiseguy (I'm a sucker for sausage and onions). I've had slices of the other pizzas (the Margherita is great and the Sonny Boy is good too if you like olives). The freshness of the ingredients and dough do shine through.\\n\\nThe killer though is the wait. If they had a bit more ambiance outside (perhaps more tables or entertainment or even passing out little samples of the pizza as an amuse bouche) or revamp Bar Bianco to accommodate more people, it would be better. \\n\\nIf I get a craving for pizza though, I'll save my sanity and go to Grimaldi's."}
{"label":0,"text":"I will never shop at Artie's Ace ever again. First, I ask one of their employees for help and his response is \\\"no English\\\". He literally did not speak one word of English. Second, I went to return Christmas lights and after debating amongst themselves whether they accepted returns they tell me it will be a 25% restocking fee. Nowhere on their receipt does it say that. I dispute this unclear policy which they did not like being questioned. Next, the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box.  Okay I will box them. But wait she says the lights must be tested. Great test them. Nope need to be boxed. Needless to say at this point I am extremely frustrated and getting mad.

{"label":3,"text":"When my partner decided that shaving facial hair was just not cutting it (too much beard shadow under the skin) we initially though to get it waxed out. I was hesitant to go the wax route, and was thrilled to find Jada in the Desert Sky mall (inside near Mervyn's). This place only does threading and henna tattooing. \\n\\nThe shop is small and personal. It's not the most luxe of interiors, but the brisk and professional service makes up for it. Having not had the threading myself, I can only attest that they threaded out my partners beard (all of it, cheeks chin neck and mustache) in about an hour and only charged us $35 for it. We were very pleased with the results and stoked about the low cost. \\n\\nMore than a handful of stray, missed hairs and a lack of lotion or balm after the procedure keeps this rating from a 5, but so long as you can provide your own aftercare I would still highly recommend Jada Beauty.\\n\\nFor those of you who have never been \\\"threaded\\\" it's a hair removal process where hair is trapped between a twisted strand of thread and pulled out by the root.

{"label":0,"text":"Worst 15 dollars that I have ever spent and that was just for lunch. Let me explain.\\n\\nI come in on a Wednesday around 11:30 am. I am greeted by the host and shown to a table. Since I have never been here before, I am briefed on the process of getting my food. They give you two of what appears to be small dog food bowls and a small dipping sauce type of cup. One bowl you put in veggies and the other meat. For the dipping sauce type of cup, yup you guessed it, different sauces to mix in to your choices when it is being cooked.\\n\\nOnce you are done selecting your choices, you go up to the counter and hand it off to whoever is there that will cook it on the big circular flat top grill. You have to specify what kind of carb you want cooked with your ingredients like brown rice, noodles, etc. Then when its done cooking, your server will  bring it out to your table.\\n\\nNow what I just described doesn't sound bad now does it? What im about to break down for you should convince you not to come here or at least if you try it, you will be uttering, \\\"Oh, that's what Roger T was talking about in his review.\\\"\\n\\nFirst off, you have two options to decide before you start eating. Single trip or all you can eat. Prices are as follows: Lunch 8.99. Dinner 10.99. Add 4 dollars more to do the all you can eat option. By the way, it used to be 3 dollars.\\n\\nSince I was really hungry and planned on making multiple trips to get my money's worth, I chose the 13 dollar all you can eat. That is just for the food yall. Drinks are not included. I decided just to have water.\\n\\nSo I do my thing and try to cram as much meat and veggies into my bowls. Their meat and veggie choices all seem to be housed in tiny containers which makes you feel like a pig if you are trying to get a lot of a certain meat or veggie. By the way, the only difference between lunch and dinner is for dinner you get calamari and scallops. That's great news you say? Well, based on what I have seen, I wouldn't be surprised if these were tiny little cut up pieces.\\n\\nI sit down and wait for my food. After about 5 minutes later, I received it in a weird odd sized bowl\/plate? When I see my food, I swear I thought I put a lot of veggies and especially meat since I am a carnivore. What you gotta understand is when all these items you select are grilled together, they shrink a lot. \\n\\nAfter I finished my bowl, I was ready to go and grab some more food. This is where the deception is because in order for you to go up and get more food, you have to tell your server exactly that and they will go get you new bowls. This is where you will notice the difference between these guys and other traditional Mongolian Grills. The ones im familiar with, you grab your own bowls and do your thing. The only waiting you do is for the cooking. Not these guys. Sometimes it takes a while for the server to come around just so you can ask for more bowls. Then you have to wait for them to come back with your bowls. Then you have to wait for it to be cooked. When it gets done cooking, it sits on the counter until your server picks it up and puts it on your table.\\n\\nSo you see this is where my gripe is. By the time I came around to my third serving, I was starting to feel that full feeling which doesn't make sense because at other places, I can easily go through 3 servings and not feeling full at all. The process that you have to go through to get your food, whatever you ate prior is starting to settle which gives you the im not hungry feeling any more. \\n\\nMy total bill came up to about 14 and some change. I put 15 bucks on the table and walked away. My server was slow in everything. Don't get me wrong. Its not like I was in a rush but at the same time I don't have all day. I think this place is a scam. Their process purposely slows everything down so you don't get to eat as much as you really want. The day I went, it didn't get really busy until about 12. When it gets really busy, you will have to wait even longer in between each serving. \\n\\nSo you see, it really isn't worth it to eat here whether you choose all you can eat or not. I recommend going to the Fiesta Buffet just up the street off of Lake Mead for their Mongolian Grill. Lunch is 7 bucks and dinner is 10 bucks with a player card. You not only get two big bowls to put ingredients in, but the only time you wait is when it is being cooked. Plus they have other choices there and not just the Mongolian. Its not the best but it sure as hell beats out these guys. This also will prompt me to check out Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill on Paradise Rd since I heard good things about them."}

Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side.

It soon became very clear that it was not our imagination and that they in fact missed deliveries on a regular basis.

The shop fees added an additional 10% to my job cost and I just feel that that is high and somewhat outrageous. When I questioned the fee I was told every shop charges that but I just feel that 10% is too high.\\n I do feel that Brandon and his staff are trying to do a good job but on this particular visit I lacked full confidence that it was done correctly but it may have been, I just don't know.

{"label":0,"text":"I stayed at the HGVS in September while I was in Vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday.  The hotel, the room, and the staff were all nice during our stay from Saturday to Tuesday.  On Tuesday my friend and I checked out around 1pm.  We didn't realize until about 6pm, while planning to get ready for dinner and the night, that we had left all of our dresses hanging in the closet in the bedroom of the hotel suite (7 cocktail dresses and the brand new North Face jacket I had received for my birthday the week prior).  We called immediately and had security check the room.  Nothing found.  We told them we would be there shortly to speak to someone and check for ourselves.  The room had not been rented out to anyone since our check-out, and security placed a hold on the room at the time we called.  We arrived at 9pm and had security escort us through the room.  Spotless room.  No dresses.  We filled out a security report and filed a claim with the company's insurance agency, which was denied.  David, the security manager who conducted the \\\"investigation\\\", was rude to me, and basically accused me of lying.  He said \\\"do you think that these housekeepers would risk losing their jobs over a dress?\\\".  Twice I called to speak to the manager on duty and was asked to be placed on hold by her and was then transferred to the security department.  I sent an email to the Public Relations Director and an email to the VP of the HGVS over two weeks ago, and have not received any response back.  I filled out a customer service inquiry online and that was not responded to directly either, but was again forwarded to the Security Supervisor whom I had dealt with prior.  This was a very disappointing experience.  I have stayed at the Hilton in the past because they are a trusted brand.  I have never had an experience like this.  Clearly, someone with access to the rooms stole my clothing out of the closet and no one at the hotel will acknowledge or take responsibility for what happened.  They refused to review the security footage.  I was even told by one staff member that they \\\"don't have security cameras\\\".  In a Las Vegas Hotel.  Right.  I do not recommend staying at this hotel and I am disappointed with the Hilton brand and will likely never stay at a Hilton again, nor recommend one."}

Then at end repeated good night to me several times , with more apologies. I am not one to yelp, but i could not hold back.

I was told that since i did not order string fries, then the combo did not apply. Still got charged $4.50 and paid extra for my drink. whatever combo they have listed is not said right. I left out the fact that i drove over 20 -25 minutes in the rain to then wait 15 minutes for my brisket sandwich. But there was no brisket. They were out of brisket and waited that time period to let me know. She told me that i could order something else. I did not order anything else. I watched my friend eat his smoked chicken sandwich.

Regardless the movers complained and moaned the whole time telling us, as customers, we were under bid by their boss.  We expressly told Mike that we had no intention of packing everything as we were willing to pay but required everything to be moved out of the apartment and unpacked by the movers.  I had to contact the owner and make an uncomfortable situation as his movers took until 2 to pack us.  Which is unacceptable, being a military wife and moving every three years I used to have a team of 3 move my home goods in under 4 hours.  Needless to say the movers were mad I had to call their superior and then in order for us to move into the townhome within a day my husband and I had to help.  By the time we got our belongings in the home we were late evening.  Granted both my husband and I were helping the whole time.

{"label":0,"text":"We signed up our baby girl for the intro swim class towards the end of June.  She attended at least 2 swim classes without incident.  She enjoyed the classes and we even gave the instructor a gratuity. We missed swim class for the July 4th weekend and when we returned for the next week's class, some child made a bowel movement in the pool & class was cancelled - understandable.  This happened for the next 3 weeks (all classes we paid for and were promised we could make up).  Then, we paid for August's lessons on or about July 27, 2014. \\n\\nOnly after we paid for August lessons were we telephoned (on our about July 30, 2014)  & informed that our baby had been \\\"under suspicion\\\" for making the bowel movements in the pool.  Mind you, our baby is exclusively breast fed & did not make solid bowel movements at all for those weeks.  Instructors who specialize in teaching infants should be somewhat familiar with the biological functions & physical development of infants.  When I spoke to the manager, Adam, about this, he seemed bewildered at the notion that an exclusively breast fed infant would not make a solid poop.\\n\\nSecond, we always dressed our baby in the approved, reusable swim diaper.  I have checked her diaper after each lesson and there has never been any trace of any bowel movement, nor are the elastics loose around her legs & waist.  Instead, the swim diaper is quit snug - so snug it leave indentations in her skin after class.  The only difference between the swim diaper we used and the School's swim diaper that they sell is that ours was white and theirs has a pattern.    \\n\\nThirdly, it was only after we paid for August lessons that we were informed that we were \\\"under suspicion\\\" and informed that we were no longer welcome at the pool.   I understand the school has a no refund policy but we feel as though we were swindled - they took our money for August and then 3 days later told us we were not welcome!  Nevermind the fact that class was cancelled for 3 times in July & we never got a refund for those classes!  Why take our money for August classes and then 3 days later tell us that we are not welcome to return?  \\n\\nWe have spoken to management on at least 3 occasions just regarding the refund.  Last week, on approximately August 4, 2014, I was advised that we would get a refund for August.  The manager asked whether I wanted it picked up or mailed.  I asked them to mail it.  When we did not receive it as of Thursday, August 8, we called again and were told that the refund was mailed on Wednesday, August 7.  When it did not arrive as of Monday, August 11, we called again and were told \\\"no refunds\\\".  Apparently, the school representative lied to us when she said it was mailed on Wednesday.  Now they say that they will see what they can do and have a manager call us. We may have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \\n\\nThis place is not good for infants as they do not understand infant development."}

{"label":0,"text":"My girlfriend was a long time patron of the Golden Nugget, and saved up for our first 3-day\/2-night romantic vacation in Vegas.  We went to the Chart House in the hotel for a fancy dinner our first night, and decided to go back to our room in the Carson Tower, because we had quite a few to drink all day.  That night between the hours of midnight to 4am while we were asleep in bed, someone came into our room and robbed us.  They stole the cash from my wallet, slot machine stubs, and her brand new Mac Book Pro on financing for 12 months.  She only had it for 1 month so far.  The front door was left ajar as we went to open it.\\n\\nWhen we realized what had happened, we immediately went to the front desk to request another room as a security guard came to take our statement while packing our bags.  We then went to the Las Vegas Metro Police station to report the stolen laptop with the serial number.  My girlfriend was a wreck, and couldn't stop crying.  We felt violated as to someone bold enough to come into our rooms while we were sleeping.  We suspected that it could have been someone on that same floor and hallway, being that it was close to the end of the hallway and exit stairwell at the end.  We figured on each end of the hallway are dome security cameras, and they can check the footage between those hours. \\n\\nThe hotel and the police department disregarded us, as we kept complaining to check the security tapes.   We asked to directly talk to the manager, and they would send a security guard (older man in his 70's) who is oblivious to the event.  We stayed for an extra day to try to connect to anyone who can help at the hotel.  They could only give us a $20 discount for the extra day.  My girlfriend is still traumatized by the events, and I am frustrated that the Golden Nugget just didn't care to react.  Our whole trip was ruined, as we felt paranoid staying in our room.  We will never go back to the Golden Nugget again, and presume that the hotel security cameras are fakes.  They kept on giving us the run-around, because they probably don't have the footage to make a case."}

{"label":0,"text":"This dump does not even deserve 1 star! I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the \\\"burrito\\\" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn't notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1\/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That's OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a \\\"rhythm\\\" going as it was busy (as I'm sure it always is since it's on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn't even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I'm not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said \\\"They all look like that\\\" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience.

A standard salad topped off with blackberries, a nice surprise.  \\nMy bolognese arrived soon after the salad was cleared. Unfortunately, this is where the meal went downhill. The pasta was tender but the sauce lacked flavor for me. Although meaty, I was hoping for a more of a tomato base. I ended up taking most of it home for hubs who really enjoyed his risotto with bacon, arugula and blue cheese.  \\nThe service was also lacking. At the beginning of the meal we spent a significant amount of time looking around and waiting to order. When asking questions about the menu we were given either  a short answer or said he didn't know because he never tried it. Overall, some parts of our experience were fantastic while others were lacking."}

{"label":2,"text":"This place will get a 3.5 stars from me, with some reservations. The problem from my point of view is there are a lot of inconsistencies everywhere. \\n\\nI've been here quite a few times. This place reminds me of places like Ichiza, meaning, I-naba has components of a dish that are really good, but in the same dish, a lot of the components are really lacking. While I think that they are doing something different that's kinda unique here, it really didn't blow me away like I feel it should have.\\n\\nNabeyaki udon - they made it with these really thick udon noodles which I never had before, and I thought that it was different, but really didn't do anything for me. I wish there were more vegetables like carrots and mushrooms. They did put in a tempura kabocha, but it was undercooked. The shrimp tempera was cooked really well and and had a light, crisp batter. The soft boiled egg was cooked nicely. The broth was ok, just a bit too sweet for my taste. I thought for $12 bucks it was a little too pricey for what I received.\\n\\nI have been here and tried their yakisoba, and while the soba noodles are a lot different than what I have had in the past, it didn't really do anything for me.\\n\\nService wasn't really that great. We had to share menus. Is it really that hard to order more menu cases and print out some more menus? I guess so. She also didn't know who ordered what. Maybe the kitchen gets confused as well. But, we came in a really big group, so maybe they aren't accustomed to that. Or she's new. There are usually a lot more questions than there are answers.\\n\\nBut, food wise, it's ok. I don't really know if I would come back here. It could be that this type of food doesn't really fit my style. I prefer bigger, simpler, and bolder flavors. Too much subtlety with food, IMO, is kinda irritating, in my book. :D"}
{"label":1,"text":"After convincing my friends to reserve at HRH vs. Cosmopolitan, had a lackluster experience at HRH.  Pushed my friends hard to stay here as it was a smaller and easier to navigate hotel - NOBU is fantastic.  Unfortunately, that was it.  Due to HRH assigning my room to someone else, we weren't able to check in for multiple hours, forcing us to re-arrange as well as miss some parts of our plans.  After multiple fiascos with re-keying the wrong room, giving our room to another group NOT in our party, and locking us out of room where we were already checked-in, the final straw came when manager came to fix issue, offered a $50 credit WHICH WAS LEFT OFF WHEN I CHECKED OUT - I had to call back and remind the manager of the situation - she promptly credited me the amount. Prior to her entrance into the process, had a hostile check-in agent (verifiable by 2 others in my party) who wouldn't help us and arguably told us that there was nothing we could do to get into OUR room, even tho it was their hotel check-in system that was preventing this.  As for the room, wiring was confusing - in order to keep bathroom light on, needed to turn on a switch in the bedroom.  BEWARE, one of our party had a \\\"room check\\\" where hotel staff came into the room UNANNOUNCED. As we were in the room, we asked what this was - they said it was standard policy.  We're a group of 40 yr old dads in corporate management - why check our rooms without permission?  completely unacceptable and shady.  Whole experience made me look bad as I had pushed for this - multiple comments from my party.  I had let the hotel know about my experience and was informed 3 TIMES that a manager would contact me - still no response, so posted my review."}

{"label":4,"text":"I've been a repeat customer since my first visit here--late night post-drinking eats--and have yet to be disappointed after each visit (lunch, dinner, more post-drinking meals).  I was definitely surprised when my boyfriend took me here (instead of Firefly), and I realized what I'd been missing out on for quite some time.  \\n\\nWith the exception of anything extremely spicy (definitely can't handle that with my sensitive stomach), I've enjoyed quite a bit of the menu.  I've had the following: \\n\\nMango Tofu -  Iused to order this a lot until I realized what I was missing when it came to eating BEEF.  Still a pretty tasty alternative, and large enough portions that if you eat this alone, you could probably still manage to take some home \\n\\nLemongrass Chicken - Pretty tasty and one of my favorites.  The first time I had this dish, I almost finished it all by myself.  Lol.\\n\\nTeriyaki Chicken - delicious\\n\\nThai BBQ Pork Spareribs - I snatched one of these from a friend's plate and he almost bit my fingers off.  Haha.  He, on the other hand, demolished the rest of the ribs and seriously kept gnawing at the rest of the meat on the bone, cherishing every bite.\\n\\nBeef Rendang - Tender, full of flavor, and another favorite dish that I've had from time to time.  I can't say that I've been disappointed whenever I've eaten this dish.  Even though it's marked as spicy on the menu, we were able to have the spice level taken down, thankfully.  \\n\\nYakitori Chicken Satay - I generally tend to get an order of these each time that I eat here.  The chicken is tender, but I really like the dipping sauce a lot more, in addition to the accompaniments--cucumber and onion.\\n\\nBlack Pepper Beef - I also like this dish.  Yes, I seem to like a lot of meat dishes, but with pepper and beef, I figured you couldn't really go wrong.  \\n\\nBrown Rice - standard brown rice\\n\\nCoconut Rice - Pretty yummy, although I don't really eat rice.  It's different, though--sweet, but still rice.\\n\\nThai Sticky Rice - This is another dish that I have tried, but is an acquired taste, as I am not really partial to rice.\\n\\nVegetable Spring Roll - Another basic staple that I order when I eat here.  Even though it's your standard fresh roll, the sauce is delicious, and the freshness is hard to beat.\\n\\nHar Gow - what you would typically find when going out for dim sum\\n\\nPad See Ew - LOVE this dish.  Noodles, eggs, broccoli, soy sauce = yummy.  I tend to just grab a tiny bit of this, but usually end up eating half, if not 3\/4 of the entire dish. Lol.\\n\\nHouse Fried Rice - This is one of the few rice dishes that I will willingly eat, especially with some extra Garlic.  YUM.\\n\\nThai Garlic Chicken - Chicken breast with garlic upon garlic?  Obviously I am a fan. \\n\\nHainan Chicken - I like this as a healthy alternative, mainly because this is steamed.  I also think that the sesame soy sauce helps bring out the tenderness of the chicken, as well as the full flavor.  Be prepared, though, that this is a HUGE dish.\\n\\nThai Garlic Beef - Beef, garlic sauce, and garlic?  Again, a fan of this dish. \\n\\nMango Sticky Rice - my boyfriend's definitely a fan of this dessert, as he loves rice, sweets, and mango.\\n\\nDelicious, delicious, delicious.  I can't help but talk about how much of this menu I love.\\n\\nIn addition, the service is great (I've eaten with larger parties of 10 to smaller parties of 2) and they're quite attentive, friendly, and helpful when it comes to suggestions and refills.\\n\\nMy only problem is that the lot gets packed at night, so plan accordingly (the plaza shares a parking lot with Firefly, Ruth's Chris, and other restaurants\/businesses.\\n\\nI will say, though, that I've enjoyed coming here--whether to grab a bite after going out, enjoying a quick lunch, sitting on the patio and listening to the DJ spin or even just sitting indoors and enjoying the company of friends\/family\/my significant other--despite the reason.\\n\\nCan't wait to come back..."}
{"label":2,"text":"Let me start by saying that the service is excellent! Brian, our waiter, was really attentive, had great recommendations, and enhanced our overall dining experience. The food and ambiance, however, were okay...nothing special. The steaks are gigantic so if you're going for portion size, this is the place to be. However, I felt like both our steaks were a little too charred and both had really large chunks of pepper scaterred throughout. We started with the crab cakes followed by the dry aged rib eye and the Kansas city strip, and then the root beer float and cookies for dessert. One of us got the pri-fix menu with the dry aged rib eye. I'd definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu since you get an appetizer, a trio of sides, and a dessert. This is a special menu you have to ask for though...so they don't offer this deal upfront. The truffle mac and cheese and brussel sprouts were my favorite dishes of the evening. However, I was disappointed by the steaks and the ambiance was underwhelming for Vegas."}

{"label":2,"text":"My best friend and some our assorted kidlets ate here last night on our way back down from Flagstaff, where we were picking up the two oldest kidlets from NAU.\\n\\nWe pulled in at 8:40 and it looked almost deserted, there were only about 2 cars in the parking lot...  Being afraid they'd already closed, I checked the hours on the door; it said it was open to 10PM, perfect.  We walk in, seat ourselves (per the sign).  The wooden highchair we found for my toddler was missing the safety belts and was more wobbly than a 50 year old Bangladesh high-rise in a category 4 typhoon.  Seriously, I wasn't even sure it was totally safe, but we didn't see another option so I kept her at arm's length just in case it started to lean dangerously as she wiggled in it.  Thankfully it held up okay, but it doesn't have too many more days ahead of it before it's fire kindling...  \\n\\nRight away a hostess came over and offered us menus and takes our drink orders: 4 waters and a Dr. Pepper.  The waitress was there just a couple minutes later to get our dinner orders and unfortunately, one of the teenagers had just wandered away 30 seconds beforehand, so we had to ask her to come back in a second to get all of our orders.  Well, nearly 10 minutes later she returned and got all of our orders.   Also, while she was gone I noted that the floor was filthy.  Really, I'm cool with rustic concrete floors, but throughout the day someone needs to be sweeping the floor.  This floor didn't look like it had been swept ALL day long with crumpled napkins, bits of smashed food, straw wrappers, crumbs, etc.  \\n\\nI ordered the mac and cheese dinner entree, with vegetables in lieu of potato side and a side salad.  My side salad was served right away and was crisp and fresh.  Very tasty.  Interestingly, they serve it with diced cucumber and tomatoes, which was different, but very tasty.  I think I liked it better that way compared to how most places serve it.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese arrived a few minutes later and while it looked delicious with a perfectly browned bread crumb topping and gooey, stringy cheesey deliciousness, and perfect al dente macaroni noodles, it was totally and utterly tasteless.  I honestly think the kitchen made it without any seasoning at all.  Now, I'm no gourmand, but I've made some home style mac and cheese in my day and there are certain things (aside from salt and pepper) you can add to give it some zing, like onion, garlic, nutmeg, mustard powder, paprika, etc..  I don't think this mac and cheese even saw salt and pepper, let alone ANY of the more complex seasonings.  Sad.  I was really enticed, because it looked so good on the surface, but it was a utter taste-flop.  My 17 month old daughter wouldn't even eat it.  Additionally, the side dish they served it with was canned peas with a couple of random pieces of carrots.  Yuck.   Note to the kitchen: canned peas are virtually inedible gray-green little balls of mush; please at least use frozen peas, they are so much better tasting and looking and practically the same price.\\n\\nMy best friend said her Cobb Salad with grilled chicken was the best she ever had, and she knows from salads.\\n\\nThe other kids ate their food without complaint, except my 15 year old nephew, who also received a side of canned peas with his dinner.  He refused to touch them and made jokes threatening to throw them, one by one, at his older sister.  Ah, the joys of older children...  ;)\\n\\n\\nAnyway, my friend and I shared a piece of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  That was superb.  And really, as most of us already know, pie is what Rock Springs Cafe is known for throughout the State, right??\\n\\nOur bill for 5 1\/2 (2 adults, 3 teens and a baby) was about $66.  We paid it, and sadly we literally weren't quite to our car in the parking lot when they turned off the lights and closed the place down.  Weird.  It wasn't even 9:20 yet."}

The ribs tasted like they were smoked and dry rubbed, pretty good even though im more a fan of a more vinegary and fatty rib. The cornbread was ok. The hot sauce was a little over powering, not from heat..it just didn't leave any room for the flavor of the meat. Overall good experience but the place was empty...so if you want a bbq place in the South Side..you should probably stop in so they keep their lunch hours."}

Brought out drinks, our order, the bill and my change. Otherwise, looking for her was like playing the game - \\\"Where's Waldo?\\\" At least she was friendly. I'll give her that much. \\n\\nAs for the food - my family ordered the Feast and it came out so fast that it explained why the food wasn't very good. Warm it up and serve it up must be their motto. The meat selections were all dry. Of the ribs, the brisket, the chicken, fries and corn, I like the fries the best. That's saying a lot considering I'm a carnivore and I love my dead, cooked animal meat. \\n\\nComparing notes of my two experiences at Famous Dave's - I have to suggest that lunch is better than dinner. It stands to reason that lunch will be fresher while dinner will be the meats prepared earlier in the day to be able to serve the evening crowd faster. Either that or the North Las Vegas location is just that bad. One day I may get around to testing this feeling ..."}

Someone told us that all the trees downtown Glendale were lit along the street. When we left the street was still not lit. What a big disappointment.

Pork Chops weren't cooked all the way.  The HUGE portion of mashed potatoes for the side wasn't bad, but they didn't give us any gravy for them.  The cajun prime rib was way over seasoned and salty.

I get it. I am complicated and so are my orders. This isn't new.\\n\\nSecond strike? They were slower than hell! \\n\\nTheir fish tacos were delicious. Oh so messy and oh so yummy.\\nBut the cactus tacos? It was just OK. And the black bean taco? Not so much.

I believe you get what you pay for however in this case I feel they have now become overpriced for a poor quality of Italian food as well as very small portions!!! I would recommend they get some new servers as well as new items on the menu or give you at least a fair portion for the price they are charging... So many better other kind restaurants in town that appreciate your business"}

We asked the bar tender what Serendipity is known for and what is a \\\"must try\\\". I guess the one in NY there's always a line out the door for the Frozen Hot Chocolate.

And just because it was Vegas and you can... I said \\\"I'll take one of each to-go as well\\\". \\n\\nMy thoughts, the Frozen Hot Choc was average, nothing I would stand in line for hours for. It's like a chocolate shake basically that's rich and tastes like it has frozen micro ice in it... the flavor is just that \\\"hot chocolate\\\"..... The mojito however.. OMG, yum! I'm not one to like greenery in my alcohol, but these were exceptional. The Cheesecake one is good if you like syrupy and sweet. My personal favorite was the Berry Mojito. \\n\\nI'd give this place another try for some of the actual food next time I'm there."}

So we made a feeble attempt to go to Body English....we waited in line for an hour (the first, last, and only time I've ever waited in a line for a club....) until we just decided to drink and gamble in the Hard Rock.  2 years later we are much older and wiser.  And better connected.   I gave my host a call who put us on the guest list.  Because we listen to everything she tells us to do we got there at 10:30 right when it was opening.  I was the first one in the club that evening.  The bouncer looked at everyone else and decided on us.  This is why I love my host.  The bouncer was even nice enough to comp us the admission price so we were the first to be let in with no waiting and no cover.  Just how I like it. \\n \\nUnfortunately, that is really where the fun ends.  Body English is really just one room.  There isn't much done to make it aesthically pleasing either.  The music was awful.  AWFUL.  I love Common, don't get me wrong, but a nightclub isn't the place.  I also wasn't impressed that they were relaxing their dress code policy and people were coming in and tshirts and sneakers.  If you're going to have a strict policy make it strict and keep it strict.  I was so underwhelmed.  I think it is just too clubby for me.....I'm more of an ultra lounge kind of gal."}

{"label":3,"text":"This was the first of three lunch dates that the No1DP and I had over our last Vegas stay. While doing research on potential restaurant dates I heard about this restaurant opening recently next to the area where the Venetian turns into the Palazzo. \\n\\nBuddy V's is the interpretation of classical, comfort Italian food of Buddy Valastro, the guy from Cake Boss. Located just inside the entrance to the Palazzo shops, there is indoor and \\\"outdoor\\\" seating, a prime location for people-watching.\\n\\nThe service was rather top-notch for a casual restaurant and what I would normally expect for fine dining. Bussers would ask to serve the last of a dish before taking it away as well as push your chair and make your napkin while you are away. I noticed that the busser's voice seemed a little nervous... maybe it was his first time working here? Still did a good job.\\n\\nWine we had was a typical low-oak Chardonnay, which brings out more of the natural flavors of the grape - a similar profile to Sauvingon Blanc. I have to thank the No1DP for this because it was him that I can start finally appreciating Chardonnay, a varietal I've disliked because of its normally oaky profile.\\n\\nI had just arrived from SD a couple hours ago, and wanting a \\\"light\\\" lunch to start our vacation, we chose to do lunch \\\"tapas\\\"-style with the following entrees:\\n\\nGarlic Bread ($9): melted mozzarella & fontina. Garlic bread was crispy. You could see the cheese melt into the bread but the cheese did not soak the bread too much, leaving the bread crispy. The slices were big and a slice and a half would be enough for me as an appetizer. They also were good with the tomato sauce from the meatballs. \\n\\nGrandma's Meatballs ($13): beef, veal & pork, tomato ragu, pecorino. Meatballs were big and juicy, but something seems missing when I just eat meatballs by itself. This seems like it would go better with a pasta dish.\\n\\nBuddy's Caprese ($16): jersey beefsteak tomatoes, burrata, charred green beans, balsamic. I judge a caprese based on 2 ingredients, the tomatoes and cheese. Cheese was laid out like a poached egg and had a texture of one but the cheese literally just seeps inside your mouth. Tomatoes were plump and juicy. The olive oil\/balsamic vinegar combination was not too heavy. Green beans were crispy and the greens were not too heavy as to let the flavors of the cheese and tomatoes shine through.\\n\\nAs we were both full and the No1DP had to go back to a workshop we didn't have room or time for dessert, otherwise I would have loved to try a dessert from the guy who is the star of CAKE BOSS.\\n\\nShould I be around the Grand Canal Shoppes area again I would definitely like to check out their dinner menu as I hear the dinners and desserts are what makes this restaurant stand out from the others."}
{"label":1,"text":"I was excited to try Smashburger today for the first time after a meeting, but I have to say...I've experienced better.  \\n\\nThe menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back (you can choose to have a 1\/3 lb, 1\/2 lb, or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger'), but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning.\\n\\nFirst off, there are no combo meals.  You have to get everything a la carte, but if you buy a side with a burger, you get $1 off the side.  Still, I got a 1\/3 lb mushroom burger with veggie frites, and I paid about $10.  No drink included.  At a place that is technically fast-food.  And THAT was supposed to be a deal.\\n\\nSecond, the veggie frites were kind of soggy.  There was no crispity crunchy outing that I would have expected from fried veggies.  And they were a bit salty.  And Smashburger was kind of stingy about how much they gave me.  The dip they gave me for the frites were good, though.  I dipped the burger in it, too.\\n\\nI mean, the employees are friendly, the food is made to order so it's fresh, you have the freedom to basically make your own burger, and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good, which is all great, but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible, better overall value can be found someplace else."}

It worked out great! =)\\n\\nI checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. Just first glance the place was packed that night. The server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. The first things I LOVE about the YH but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, The list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. I went with the Kona Brewery Fire Rock Ale. I love my Kona Brewery not only because from Hawaii but good beer! The most common one see is Longboard so saw another one on tap! Hell yay! The rest of the night went with another my favorite Firestone Pale Ale. It another one that hardly see on tap at bars. I love there beer still have since visited Firestone winery. \\n\\nThe food was good as always! It been while but remember the Hawaiian Poke Stack stood out for me. Poke never go wrong in life. I love the way everything balances together. The Poke nice and fresh soy style Poke. The crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the Poke. The vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. The wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. It daunting looking at it start height. Once break down all good stuff. The second app had the bearnaise slider. Honestly not really big fan. I asked the server she recommend as second app. It more miss then hit. The slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. The bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. You combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. Ok. Sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.\\n\\nI had the Street Taco (Chicken tinga). I wanted too try something different then my last visit. I glad I did! It was awesome. The combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. I enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. I added the beans and rice. The rice was tasty stuff. The beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff. \\n\\nDessert my cousin and I split a Lemon Souffle off our sever recommendation. She got right on. It was not your traditional souffle. That it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. It smaller portion really for one. Dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. It was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top. It perfect dish too end the night. Good good, good times, and family!!"}

It's an expensive restaurant, but it's something special, so if you are in Vegas for good food, go to Jasmin.

Reid's has a lock on these specialty foods with a nice looking meat department, array of choice cheeses and impressive wine selection. Let's break down this location a bit, shall we?\\n\\nThe Good: As mentioned, it's a great spot to grab a quick bite, snag a bottle of wine, some tasty snacks and get on your merry way. The service is pretty spectacular - whether your seeking said bottle of wine or dining on a sandwich during lunch. Many of the sandwiches and salads I saw coming around looked fresh and delicious. Also, there's a decent sized wine bar next to the wine vault\/selection area that could kick your feet up while you taste away. \\n\\nThe Meh: The parking is pretty much horrendous. Unless you're stealing parking from business across the street, you better be comfortable walking a ways. The sandwich I ate here was underwhelming - the grilled pimento cheese was gut busting-ly greasy (granted, it's grilled pimento cheese) and also missed the zing I was looking for. I barely got through half of the sloppy mess and had to put it down for fear that I may have a heart attack in the shop. \\n\\nIf I'm walkin' around Selwyn and need to score a few snacks before heading home, Reid's is a fine choice, yet they definitely have plenty of competition in the area if we're talking tasty sandwiches and wine tasting!"}

I would give it three stars, but the fact that a valet driver almost killed me on the way out really just added to my disappointment in this place, so two stars it is.\\n\\nService: We sat in the bar booths.  Our waitress came by right away to take our drink order and wanted to take our food order, but we had barely looked at the menu.  We told her we needed a few minutes to decide, and then she didn't come back for almost 15 minutes!\\n\\nFood: I very much enjoyed my veggie burger and the order of Baltimore Fries (read: fries smothered in brown gravy).  My husband, however did not enjoy his bacon and bleu burger.  He ordered it medium rare and it came out well done.  No pink at all.  The bacon was burnt and too crispy for a burger.  You could tell the bacon had just been sitting back in the kitchen.  The burgers were $9 and came with a small serving of potato chips, which I thought was a fair price.  The fries, however, were $5 and such a small serving!  Disappointing.  Also disappointing were the drinks.  I ordered their take on an Old Fashioned which didn't resemble an Old Fashioned at all.  It was really basically just a bourbon and ginger.  And it was $10!!  Man, I can go down to the Strip and get a better drink for that price.  This is a burger place!  In a shopping mall!  $10 for a drink?  Oh, and the sliders are $8 for TWO of them.  Are you kidding me?  This place is flat out too expensive.\\n\\nSetting:  If you sit in the bar booths, be very careful because the bottom of the booths are extremely raw and sharp!  I was wearing skinny jeans and flat, so my ankles were exposed.  At one point my ankle grazed the bottom of the booth and it hurt!  I thought, \\\"Geez, they need to sand down the edges or something.\\\"  When I got home, I realized my ankle was still stinging.  I looked down and there was dried blood on my ankle!!  The booth freaking cut me!!\\n\\nValet:  When you walk out of the restaurant, it is located right next to the valet parking lot.  As my husband and I were crossing the street, a valet driver came screaming out of the lot like a bat out of hell and literally drove straight toward me, slamming on the brakes and stopping just inches from me.  I am not exaggerating.  I looked at him and cursed at him.  He didn't respond, just slammed on the gas as soon as I stepped out of the way and then he cut off another car.  What a horribe valet driver!  No remorse for almost hitting me or cutting off another vehicle.\\n\\nLackluster food\/drink and a near death experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

He refused to honor it because the transaction was done.  It was done 2 min ago!!! I won't be back and I told him that.  It's not that he couldn't do anything it's that he didn't want to.  Horrible management and customer service here.   My first and last time here.   They lost me as a customer."}

The bottle service really made for a great experience. 1 bottle of ciroc for 4 girls. We drank it all and had a blast.  The cushioned bench style seat was comfortable. The view from bottle service section is excellent. It's fun to have some drinks, get up off your seat and dance with your friends.  The stage props and dancers really help this show.

{"label":1,"text":"A very odd experience.  \\n\\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \\n\\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \\n\\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \\n\\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \\n\\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about."}

{"label":2,"text":"Being from the East Coast and living in NYC I've never been curious about CPK. But stuck in an airport for a few hours and hungry, I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nComfortable seating area with a bar and the hostess saw me holding my laptop and automatically seated me near an outlet. Very nice. The service was really mixed though. I was asked to pay my bill while I was still eating (I wasn't eating slowly or anything). It was a pain because my hands were kind of greasy and pizza-covered.\\n\\nThe pizza is decent. The crust tastes like really high-quality frozen pizza though. I'd be very surprised if it was anything but just that. The toppings and combination were great and I scarfed the whole personal size pie down. \\n\\nOverall reminds me a bit of a higher-end Papa John's pizza. It can't really compare to a NYC slice -- chain pizzerias just get their own category and based on that, CPK is alright."}
{"label":1,"text":"Hyper-expensive shopping venues are the Cornerstone of City Center. You'll see a lot of people window shopping, but not much buying going on. I've visited there on a weekend, and couldn't believe how dead it was in there. To be honest, even with the sticker shock, one wonders how they pay the rent for this place. \\n\\nThat being said, the free tram service between venues is the best feature this landmark has to offer. Don't get me wrong, the surrounding casinos as gorgeous, but the shopping mall they built in the center of this feels more like a soulless Rodeo Drive they plucked up and put in the middle of the dessert, only with a lot less foot traffic."}

{"label":1,"text":"A roulette dealer told me that the food quality in Vegas restaurants has really gone downhill, perhaps due to the rising meat prices. I came here in 2010 and had a lovely steak dinner. This time around I pondered trying something else so I inquired about the scallops. The waitress highly recommended them so I went for it. My friend ordered the chicken grand mere. Bread came promptly and was quite good, accompanied by whipped butter. We sat outside on a Tues early evening under a heat lamp and enjoyed the people watching. It was early enough to get a seat outside (around 6 I believe) as by the time we left the once-empty inside was full. Sadly my scallops, all four of them, arrived cold and were chewy and very bland. The squash pur\\u00e9e was a cool temperature and there were only about five brussel sprouts on my plate. Good thing I'd eaten a lot of bread. I sent back the scallops and was told they'd be reheated. The waitress and busboy were very nice and caring. I have nothing bad to say about the service other than the waitress's bad call on the scallops. I was offered a complimentary refill of my rose champagne as I waited for my meal. Meanwhile my friend was pretty happy with his chicken but not in amazement by any means. It was juicy and was a good amount of chicken. Potato pur\\u00e9e was tasty as were the roasted garlic and onions. Just don't expect very much of the sides. Scallops came back to me warmer but I had zero love for them. I ate them because I was hungry. They really really needed some kind of sauce. I think I know what rubber soles taste like now. It was my birthday and I was given a profiterole which was tasty. The two meals with two glasses of $11 champagne (not counting my complimentary one) plus tip came to $112. Disappointing since I'd felt like I had to force myself to eat the scallops. No enjoyment at all. Like several other places i revisiting on this trip after great experiences in 2010, I'm crossing Mon Ami Gabi off my list and will search for more consistently good places to patronize."}

{"label":3,"text":"Thanks to being one of the lucky winners of two-day passes to the recent Formula Drift event, I got to spend two evenings at the speedway.  It had been a very long time since my last visit; probably 8 years.  During my last visit my awesome physics teacher in high school had us all come to the speedway and learn about acceleration the fun way: through drag racing!  Remember to bring your earplugs if you come for this!\\n\\nFor the Formula Drift event, the speedway was far from reaching capacity.  Plenty of parking was available, as well as seating during the event.  Spectators are able to watch from the fence (and consequently covered in rubber from the drifters!) or sit on the bleachers.  The restrooms were not too packed, and had both soap and paper towels; this can be rare during public events!  There were also several food and drink vendors which, as could be expected, were a bit pricey.  Water was $4, iced tea $8, shaved ice $5, beer $1...yep, somehow beer was the cheapest beverage!\\n\\nI'm not too involved in motor events, so I can't say that I'll be returning here anytime soon.  I also find this a hard place to rate, as I didn't really make much use of the venue outside of the restrooms.

{"label":0,"text":"Recently went to Vegas with a large group with limited funds.  So we booked the Tropicana.\\n\\nWe'd read the reviews here, so we knew this wasn't a luxury hotel.\\n\\nAnd the rate was, of course, very good.  Around $50 a night.\\n\\nBut we ended up leaving after one night.  We stayed in the Island Tower.\\n\\nFirst off, they couldn't confirm that the whole group would be kept together.  So if you book a large group make them confirm in writing that the rooms will be together.\\n\\nSecond, the very hard, ancient mattress was so uncomfortable that we couldn't sleep on it.\\n\\nThird, the hotel is under construction, and the construction crews start VERY early.  We were awakened at around 5 am by construction right outside our window, several floors down.\\n\\nOverall, the decor is looking worn and sad.  But that's to be expected.\\n\\nBut the weirdest thing is the layout.  The rooms are a very long distance from the lobby and casino, down very confusing hallways, so you spend a great deal of time walking, trying to figure out where you are, etc.\\n\\nThe ceilings are also very low, which I guess was common in construction of the time.  \\n\\nAlso, they charged a 'not optional'  'resort' amenities charge of around $10, supposedly for use of the gym\/spa\/pool.   The pool was closed completely - you couldn't even go out into the landscaped gardens at all.  The gym was tiny.   But you are charged this anyway.  I'd have been fine with that if they'd disclosed that, but they charge it separately so they can give you a lower room rate over the phone and on website search engines.  The only option we had was to pay the charge or try to find another hotel, after a long, tiring flight.\\n\\nTo me, this is a dishonest business practice and should be illegal.  Particularly since their website doesn't list the fact that the pool is totally closed, and their reservations folks don't tell you about the 'resort fee'.\\n\\nThe rooms were dated but of decent size.  The beds had mirrored ceilings, which I found to be humorous.  \\n\\nThe bath was adequate, with a large triangular tub.  But there was mold in-between the shower tiles.   So much so that it was disconcerting.  \\n\\nThe shower head was mounted very low, as was the custom decades ago.  So it's hard for a tall or even normal size person to shower comfortably.\\n\\nBut overall, other than the shower, the room and the rest of the hotel was clean.\\n\\nOne other thing - one side of the hotel faces the airport.  Literally the closest large casino to the airport.  And the noise from the planes can be pretty bad in the rooms on that side.   Oddly, they seem to book that side first, even though it would seem to be a lot louder.\\n\\nIf you do stay here because of the price, do NOT try the buffet.  It's one of the worst I've had.  Food has no flavor, selections are pretty limited, much of it clearly sits out for hours, etc.  We got a 24 hour buffet pass but went elsewhere for meals whenever we could. Go across the street to the MGM or other places for the buffet.  Or, better yet, plan to be a the Wynn (a cab ride required) for the best buffet in town.\\n\\nOn the positive.....\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and professional.  Their bartender makes a very good bloody mary.  \\n\\nWhen we went to check out early they were very friendly.  I suspect they get people leaving early quite often.\\n\\nI actually felt bad for the staff, as I'm sure they get a lot of people that are mad about the 'resort fee' add-on and the conditions in many of the rooms.   It's not the staff's fault, and I'm sure a lot of people take it out on them.\\n\\nMy advice to the Tropicana?  Book people into the Paradise Tower away from renovation noise if at all possible, even without them asking for it.  If they call the front desk to complain about noise or the bed, just offer to rebook them right then.  Otherwise many are going to leave.\\n\\nAnd buy new mattresses or at least very thick mattress protectors\/pads, even before the renovation is done.  The ones there now are very hard."}

{"label":2,"text":"I went to RR with my 5 year old on a daddy daughter date night on Saturday.  She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.   \\n\\nI ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.\\n\\nOur dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.\\n\\nWhen we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entr\\u00e9e and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.\\n\\nDid I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.\\n\\nOverall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree."}

I just moved to NV in the Henderson area and needed to find my regular nail salon here.  After searching a bunch of places online, I decided to try Nail Envy based on the reviews it had.\\n\\nEverything that people say is 100% true.  Convenience? Amazing.  It is so incredibly easy to make a same day appointment online and get confirmation of it - I've never gotten that luxury from any other salon.  Their service? Exceptional.  I had trouble locating the place since I am new in town and Nick was incredibly helpful on the phone and it was no problem that I ended up being a little late for my appointment time. In addition, everyone speaks perfect English and is very interactive with their clients holding conversations with them and it was apparent they truly care about and know their clientele very well which, in my opinion, sets them apart.\\n\\nThe quality?  Unbelievable.  I stuck with a regular manicure for the first time just to test out the place and see if I liked it.  If the quality of a regular manicure is this good I can't imagine the quality of a gel manicure which is what I will be getting every few weeks from this point forward at Nail Envy.  In addition, it is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN without sacrificing comfort.  Finally, the prices are some of the best I've seen in the area in all honesty.\\n\\nTwo thumbs WAY up and a round of applause.  Needless to say, I found my nail place here in Henderson and will be a regular customer as of today. \\n\\nA big thank you to Nail Envy for truly exceptional business operations!"}
{"label":2,"text":"My return visit to Rachel's Kitchen! I arrived just around 11:20 AM on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling, although not overly packed. The outside dining area had pretty much every table full of Summerlin moms and a scattering of elderly people and young people enjoying brunch or just coffee outside in the nice weather. I believe Rachel's Kitchen attracts quite a wide range of people.\\n\\nI ordered the Breakfast Burrito and asked for bacon to be put it in it. The service was very nice and the cashier was pleasant. I quickly retreated outside to find a place to sit and found a partially-shaded table that was perfect. \\n\\nThe food came out quick. I thought the burrito was very generous with its fillings. There was a lot of eggs, very well cooked, and a good amount of bacon. The pico de gallo inside was not over-powering (especially for someone like me, who HATES cilantro). However, my same complaint as before - I saw avocado on the ingredients list and I was over-joyed with happiness - BUT the burrito was somewhat lacking in my expectation of avocado goodness. Perhaps I have learned my lesson and will order EXTRA avocado from here on out. The burrito also came with little potatoes and ketchup to dip them in. I only had a few, because the burrito was very large, in fact - I didn't finish it!\\n\\nRachel's Kitchen is great for an outdoor brunch. I do like it, but again it is in The District and if you can deal with a little bit of the snooty customers who inhabit this particular shopping center, than you will be fine.

Already being a big fan of Phoenecia, I was a little hesitant at first to try Haji Baba, but I had a feeling that I would like it so I gave it a shot. There are three things that you absolutely have to try, and they are:\\n\\nThe falafel sandwich.\\n\\nThe gyro plate.\\n\\nThe dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).\\n\\nLike most of the reviews read, the falafels are some of the best around! They don't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor...not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap! As for the gyro plate, I have one thing to say...BEST GYRO MEAT IN PHOENIX! There, I said it. The meat is seriously succulent (you hear that about steak, not gyro meat!), no exaggeration. Just think of the best gyro meat you've ever tasted, but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around. Remember to get the plate when you go and I don't think you will regret it. And lastly, try the dolmas. I say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that I've been to, and that is warm. Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.  Get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance (not to be confused with the pee pee dance...taste buds don't pee).\\n\\nThere you have it!

{"label":2,"text":"I came to Da Emma on a Friday night around 6pm, right when they open for dinner service. I adore the architecture\/layout\/atmosphere with the heavy metal doors and the rustic feel of the ex-womens' prison. \\n\\nIf you look to your right upon entering the restaurant, you'll see boards filled with pictures of eminent celebrities, athletes, randoms posing with I guess, Da Emma. Knowing that Angelina Jolie, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson, George Clooney (to name a few) had also dined at Da Emma made the experience more memorable.\\n\\nWe were seated right away and brought a plate of bruschetta and the menu.

Next was the squid ink pasta for $19, it is expensive and sadly lacks in any flavor or acceptable qualities - 1 star. I have had several great squid ink dishes in the past, this one lacked any texture or taste... it was very basic. We ate a few bites and moved on to dessert.

Both companies used the same machines, and the process was similar.  However, the customer service was much better at LVCH.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They massage your feet and stomach during the colonic.  (Some people may prefer to be left alone, and they will if you request) However, I think you benefit from getting the stomach massage.  Although, it feels like torture during the process.  Getting a colonic is not my favorite thing to do, but this place makes the best of an awkward situation.  I also recommend trying the sauna which seems to help if you get it done prior to your colonic.  There are many other treatments that I have yet to try.\\n\\nAlso, they have the most flexible hours."}
{"label":1,"text":"I'm Mexican-American, Arizona native-born and raised here.  Excuse me, the owner is Greek origin.  He doesn't really know what \\\"real\\\" Mexican food taste like and the people he hires are \\\"fly by night\\\" cooks.  I've experienced better quality Mexican food elsewhere because here it's not only very expensive, they used the same ingredients in their soups but change meats.  Burritos, combos, appetizers, soups, signature seafood, breakfast combos and burritos are small and too expensive.  It's no wonder nobody notices because most patrons are too drunk to see the price is too high.  Tacos are the only reasonably-priced menu items that are worth having.  There are better authentic Mexican restaurants nearby, such as, Herrera's, Valle de Luna, and original Garcia's on 35th Ave & south of McDowell Rd (with music).  The decorations they have is overwhelming and looks like they are hoarding them but most everyone is too drunk to notice.  They hired girls who dress a bit SLEAZY to get the patrons to buy more drinks.  What happen to this place, the owner got greedy and needs money.  What is with the 3-5 star ratings!  Are you blind!  Oh, yeah and they are now so s-l-o-w, it took them 35 minutes to make two lousy fish tacos.  Who they hired beginner cooks!  And they put up phony food photos, the portions are much smaller.  Any reviews prior to spring of 2013 are way better than after the summer of 2013."}
{"label":3,"text":"This review is only for the club.\\nThis new club has quite the line up of DJ's, and the weekend we were there Tiesto was spinning on Sat night! Being that he is among the top DJ's on the planet, we figured it would be packed so, of course, I turn to my fellow Yelpsters for advice...\\nLet me confirm and clear up a few things now that I have been there. \\nFirst the nerve-wrecking stairs, this is a 5 story spot, but the club is only 3 stories. You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.\\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back room is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to us it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way less busy and hoooook it up!\\nThird the nice staff, this one is true! These were without a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and we have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the normal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. \\nFourth the dress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions flip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the guys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...\\nFifth the music in the hip hop room, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not stay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres of hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!\\nLast the dance floor, prior posts are accurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people. The main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist pump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance. There is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure turned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look through the VIP's lining the rail. \\nThe lack of dance floor space is the reason I knocked a star off. All in all this is a great club, and with DJ's like Tiesto how can you go wrong."}

Maybe it's because I'm spoiled after having pizza as delicious as Joe's NY Pizza in Old Town, but this pizza is a big yawn.  The venue is great.  They just need a new recipie for pizza."}

The food screams comfort but the ambiance just screams. Too bright, uncomfortable and worst of all, there are always dirty tables. They have young kids waiting tables, but they aren't trained well. They bring your food one plate at a time, no silverware. When we finished both of the last two times they brought a dessert menu, came back and we declined dessert, then they went away and came back with the check, we paid and they collected the money - all the while never clearing our plates!  My suggestion - train the waitstaff and clean up the dining room and make it more homey. And for goodness sake get rid of that horrible cart just inside the door - and that weird cluttered 1\/2 booth by the door."}

{"label":2,"text":"Relative to Cirque's \\\"O\\\" and Dragone's \\\"Le Reve\\\" this is not a five star show. That being said, this was a very visually beautiful and entertaining show in its own right. Mystere had its residence at the Treasure Island since 1993 and not a shortage of fans throughout the years, despite there being six other Cirque shows on the strip. As most of the other Cirque shows, Mystere combines a mixture of circus skills, dance, opera, music, and comedy. The awe-inspiring performance features a story that attempts to integrate human actors into a seamless whole to capture the complexity that we call life. The story itself is difficult to explain as it intertwines a magical word, exotic creatures and the world as we know it. In short, Mystere is a celebration of life.\\n\\nI did not like that the theater did not have a restroom and you had to venture into the casino to use the restroom.

{"label":3,"text":"Not gonna lie, I'm super shocked that this place is owned by Eat'n Park, which is one of my least favorite eating establishments on the face of this earth. But I'm definitely glad that this place popped up in Oakland rather than the traditional Eat'n Park that was rumored to be planned for the location. I'm also thankful that the building is well-designed and doesn't look like an ugly eyesore in the middle of Schenley Plaza. So while I wish that the space had been left empty and full of nice green grass, it is what it is and at least The Porch has some pretty decent food to show for it.\\n\\nIt is an odd location. I don't think the average broke college student is going to be too excited about $8 margaritas and $20 duck drumsticks. Questionable business plans aside, I really enjoyed my dinner here. The calamari with zucchini straws was perfect! Tentacles included (my fav, I'll fight for those!) so you know it's the good stuff, and it came with lots of lemon wedges and a homemade marinara sauce. It's like they read my mind! I also was in love with the pork belly with pumpkin and fennel...so autumnal! The dish was pretty greasy but hey, it's a chunk of pure animal fat, so what's a little bit of extra grease, really? Other than that it was ridic tasty. The homemade soda was also fabulous though it would definitely taste better with vodka (why do they only have two cocktails on the menu? and one is tequila-based? bummer).\\n\\nThe one part of my meal that fell short was the Rieger Pork Soup. The concept is perfection--french onion soup with pork. Where could that go wrong? Unfortunately, the soup was completely devoid of flavor. Once I dumped half the salt shaker in it, it became edible, but the main problem was that the onions were not caramelized at all. Topped with a bland slice of cheese, it was the only disappointment of my meal.\\n\\nI do have to say, all the raves about the atmosphere are kind of off. I could imagine it being a great lunch spot with all the natural light coming through the windows, but at dinnertime, the lights were WAY too bright. The cheap cafeteria vibe (or should I say, Eat'n Park vibe) was totally offputting and an inappropriate match for the sophisticated food. Otherwise, the space is cute, cozy, and well-utilized.

{"label":3,"text":"1-6-15 My first visit.   I had a doctor's appointment nearby so I dropped in about 4:30PM.    First impression from outside..uh... mediocre.  Looks like any ol' bar.\\nThe inside is entirely different.  It's just pretty.  Because of the time I went, it was nearly vacant so I headed to the bar to eat.\\n\\nI wasn't sure what I wanted but I received menu, water, utensils, napkins, etc quickly and plenty of time to examine the menu, wine selection, beer selection etc and ask questions.  The server\/bartender seemed genuinely nice as did what seemed to be a \\\"regular\\\" on the opposite side of the bar so we had a pleasant conversation before and during my meal.\\n\\nI ordered the Lobster Bisque and Scallops with rice cakes.  The Lobster Bisque was good and as a friend told me, it was hot.  (We both have the pet peeve of \\\"warm\\\" food.)  It was moderately priced so I didn't expect or receive chunks of lobster but flavor was good... I would have loved just a drizzle of brandy on top... but not everyone likes it that way.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the scallops.  It took me a while and and an explanation to figure out the \\\"rice cakes\\\" part.  The long, narrow dish contained a perfectly cooked scallop, then a rice cake, then a scallop, etc.  The rice cakes were actually similar to risotto balls.  The change in textures and flavors was a surprise but I liked it.  Seriously though, I haven't had such a perfectly cooked scallop in forever.  Good sear on outside that gave it a slightly smoked flavor and just barely, barely done.  \\n\\nI agree with other reviewers that highest mark goes for ambiance.  Given it was nearly empty because of the hour and slow period after the holidays, I really want to check it out on a Friday or Saturday evening and see if they can keep up the friendly genuine service, quick service, and good food.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty big so I would expect some things to be not so good.  One patron recommended the fried gnocchi... but that seemed sacrilegious to me (and higher probability of being less than stellar)\\n\\nI'm going to take a WAG and say the reviews about not so great food have to do with the larger than average menu.  Yes, I watch way too many cooking channel shows!!\\n\\nNone the less, I'm going back.  It's a beautiful restaurant and there's plenty of potentially delightful things on the menu so if they can execute consistently, it could new fav for me."}
{"label":2,"text":".... I reallllly want to like this place but there's just something standing in my way.... This place is not as meticulously maintained as other studio's however that is what gives this place character in my opinion and well the prices are also not as high as Karve and they have more variety in their classes lol. The location could be better, it's slightly off the 101 in an older shopping complex that does not lend itself to feeling safe when you're entering or exiting an evening class. Each time I've attended a session, I have always felt like the staff was friendly but fake.... For me that is really off putting. Also the general vibe is that of a dancers studio (which I like) with a bunch of cliquey old lady dancers (which I could do with out).  I really think this place would do much better if the environment was more welcoming especially to women who are not dancers per se but just want to branch out and try some thing new."}
{"label":4,"text":"We were starving and wandering around Scottsdale Quarter, so we decided to pop into True Food to eat. In spite of there being lots of open tables, they said there would be an epic wait - or we could sit with some strangers or on a sofa outside. I didn't feel like doing either of those things, so we split and headed south. I used yelp to find the best place that was still open and on the way. \\n\\nIl Bosco showed up with the best overall score, and neither of us had eaten here so we decided to give it a shot. It's tucked away in a little nook next to Handlebar J's and looked cute and inviting. We wandered in and were seated right away. It's a cozy little place - clearly decorated with care and love.\\n\\nWe both ordered water (sparkling and still) and they came in these fancy artisan bottles that were left at our table along with a pair of small glasses filled with ice. I like when restaurants do this. They also brought out a tiny strange plate with olives on it. Neither of us eat olives, so we sorta poked at them, puzzled over them and dared each other to eat one. \\n\\nThe menu was elegant and beautiful - simple and hand written. We later got an explanation from the owner that he had a local artist make them by hand. Details details... this place is rich in details. The items on the menu were pretty much just salads and pizzas. \\n\\nEverything about this place says \\\"fancy fine-dining\\\" and if I hadn't looked at the prices I would've thought it was going to be too rich for my blood. As it turns out, the prices were VERY reasonable. The only thing I thought was a little pricey was the water - on any other night I would've ordered wine though, and the wine prices were appropriate. \\n\\nWe ordered a pizza (half and half - something you can do as long as the sauces match) and a caesar salad. They brought some artisan bread with herb oil for us to snack on, and we made that disappear. The salad was split into two plates and we quickly ate that up as well - it wasn't drowning in dressing. It was an excellent presentation and a good salad. \\n\\nThe pizza then arrived... it was about a 10-12\\\" woodfired pizza. My half was pepperoni and sausage. Her half was just cheese. Each half had a name on the menu - girls names if I remember correctly. We each took a piece over to our plates and started digging in. Right off the bat, I noticed how rich and creamy the cheese was. The pepperoni was light and had a perfect amount of spice behind it. The sauce was flavorful. The most notable part was the crust though - light, crisp, airy, and delicate. \\n\\nWe both cleaned our plates - the only things we left behind were the olives. We also ordered a dessert - creme brule - it was one of the best I've ever had. We were both full, but we didn't feel like we needed to be wheeled out to the car in a cart. It was the perfect amount of food. It was also pretty inexpensive for what you get. This is high quality fine dining with great atmosphere and attentive staff. This is a new date-night spot for me. It's also inexpensive enough to make it a regular spot.\\n\\nHad a chat with the owner who was waiting on us most of the night, and he seems like a great guy. We could tell that he loved his business. I like supporting local businesses, and this 5 star review is one of the most deserved that I've ever given."}
{"label":2,"text":"I like it here. It used to be a 24 hour it's a grind, (which I loved) but they closed it out and changed the name to what it is now. It's a step away from starbucks, they have really tasty pastries, the breakfast sandwhiches, and bagels are good, but the only downside is that they're a little greasy. The coffee never tastes like that nasty, bitter, pikes place or bold roast that starbucks offers. Their wifi is timed, but they'll give you more hours if you ask. Their prices are reasonable, and they have two really comfy couches, and standerd sit down tables for everyone else. Small place, but i'd rather go here then sb's."}
{"label":1,"text":"My fiance and I had planned to grab a bite to eat at Noble's next door to here and found they were way too slammed to get a table so we wandered into here. The atmosphere in the Constitution Bar is very nice. I could have seen it being a place we frequent a lot but, unfortunately, the service we received was abysmal. \\n\\nMy fiance first had to wander around and ask them if they were still serving food (they were when we came in) so we grabbed a seat at the bar. It was a pretty quiet night, honestly and it took the bartender close to 20 minutes to even acknowledge us. When he finally did we ordered a bottle of wine, which he seemed clueless about. I thought maybe he just didn't hear us so I repeated myself a few times and finally had to point it out on the menu before he knew which one we were speaking about (he also mispronounced riesling...which, I realize is a bit nitpicky but if you work in a bar you should be able to accurately identify something as basic as that). We also mentioned that we were wanting to order food as well. \\n\\nThe bartender came back with out bottle, charged us for it, then told us that the kitchen had just closed. If we'd have been served when we came in, we'd have been able to get some dinner. I realize this may be a fault of our own but I find it a bit dubious that it wasn't said before he gave us our drinks. That said, the wine was over chilled and not very good and we ended up leaving most of it behind to go somewhere else. I don't think I'd ever return her just because of the service alone but it gets an extra star for the nice atmosphere."}

They don't have much of a side order selection but the salad and the sides that come with the meal is good.  The only problem is that half the restaurant is for KBBQ so seating is very limited and it can take very long to get a table when it's busy.  The service is decent.  A server will come around now and then and ask if you want to order more but its hard to get their attention when they are  running around."}

{"label":0,"text":"Stopped in on Sunday evening (6'ish).  It happened to be a place to eat on the walk back to our hotel.  Patio was full but inside it was half empty.  Got seated immediately.  I knew it was a tourist trap but even with that I was surprised how bad the service and food was.  Had to beg for our (mediocre) chips and salsa.  After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3\/4 full *sigh*.  \\n\\nAt this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.\\n\\nContinuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...\\n\\nI know the patio has a nice people\/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place."}

I like the look and feel, minimalist with appropriate signage.  \\n\\nIf I were doing a detox cleanse, then I might consider these juices for meal replacements.  Otherwise, the price tag is steeper than Whole Foods for the same product of juice.  I've tried Kaleidoscope Juice in Scottsdale and Juicd Life at the Biltmore in the past.  Those reviews will be posted soon.  Any cold-pressed juice in the Phoenix Metro area is going to be pricey, it takes more time and  more veggies than you can imagine to make the 16 oz. portions that we enjoy.\\n\\nWith that said, I will revisit Juby True again, not sure of the frequency though."}

{"label":4,"text":"I have been scarfing down Lindo Michoacan's fresh tortilla chips and salsa since I was 10.  My Mom, on advice of a fellow ER Doctor, dragged my Father and I one day to Lindo .. back then, it was a tiny, one room restaurant.  Quaint, warm and the food was as authentic as one could get in Mexico.  We were thrilled.  As a family, we frequented Mexico quite often, so finding a proper Mexican restaurant off the Strip was a highlight back in the day.\\n\\nFlash forward to present day, where Lindo has now expanded to a 4 room, plus bar, famous and popular restaurant.  My Dad has since become great friends with the owner, even traveling to Europe with Javier.  \\n\\nThe food is what is most impressive with Lindo's history.  The quality has perfectly remained the same.  An older Mexican woman still stands in the middle of the restaurant, hand rolling out tortillas and frying them before your eyes.  The chips, pico de gallo and fresh table side guacamole is still amazing.  Everything on the menu is authentic .. the recipes are from inland Mexico .. this is not your \\\"Mexican Americano\\\" menu, but instead, true Michoac\\u00e1n fare.  After traveling all throughout Mexico frequently, and living in Mexican restaurant laden San Francisco and Southern California, Lindo Michoacan is still, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant.\\n\\nNow that I have moved from my hometown of Las Vegas, it is a priority that we dine at Lindo Michoacan each visit.  Although I am not entering that same quaint and unknown restaurant, once I taste the food, the memory of sitting there as a 10 year old comes rushing right back."}

Actually I forgot what I put on it and went a little crazy. \\n\\nIt was a nice thin crust pizza with a nice little kick to the pizza with the buffalo sauce. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was actually good. I was able to gobble the whole thing without stuffing myself. My daughter was able to eat her whole pizza too. \\n\\nNot a bad place to pick up a quick pizza. They even have salads if you like. \\n\\nOverall, I thought that the service was very friendly and patient, fresh ingredients, and good pizza. Love the custom made pizza without the extra charges.

The rice that came with the meal was tasty, and the beans - wow, they're knock-your-socks-off good! We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil. Hmm, culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people. A great, generous meal for $5.35, tax included. So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods!"}

They just can't seem to comprehend it...\\n\\nAnyhoo, this airport is fine for what it is. It has a worn down feel to it. Not sure if the slot machines are a pro or con, since I'm not a gambler.

I guess there really aren't many weather issues here (vs. fog in SFO or snow in Denver). If you check your bag, it's pretty easy to find the carousel that you need. And if someone is picking you up, parking in the garage is cheap ($2\/hour) and the drive-by pickup is easy too.\\n\\nI don't cringe when booking a flight into McCarran, but I don't necessarily jump up and down with excitement, either.

It was not a disappointment. The wait was not bad, it was about 20 minutes. Once we were seated we placed out order for four pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of craw-fish. We stuck to the mild and medium. Great kick.. The craw-fish and shrimp were huge, both in flavor and size. \\n\\nEverything about this place was great. The servers busted their buts to make sure that our table was clean and that we were served. They took good care of us. \\n\\nIf you live in Las Vegas, or passing through after a few slots, this is the place to go. Your hands are the forks and knife and the table is your plate. Dive in and enjoy!"}
{"label":0,"text":"Well I am eating here right now and all I can say is blah.  We ordered potato skins and a western burger. The potato skins came out the same time as our burger. I really hate when I get my starter the same time as my meal. The potato skins are just \\\"eh\\\" and the burger wasn't much better. On a scale of 1-10 i give it a 1. The bun was cold and hard, the onion straws were chewy and the ham tasted off.  So would I tell someone to come here for the food? No way. I've had better burgers at jack in the box. So if you drive by this place just keep going. Believe me I'm doing you a favor."}

Fast forward to the finger food (muffins) and it's only making your stomach quake with anticipation.  \\n\\nI went with a starter of soup and wow, this corn chowder is amazing, so amazing that anytime I am in Vegas I will make it a point to stop in and get it.  For the main entree I must admit I spaced and ordered *gasp* a burger (I did and while it wasn't bad it was defiantly not showcasing what Bobby can really do, sorry bro I'll pick the rib eye next time).  \\n\\nService was prompt and courteous and they seemed to understand the menu pretty well as my friends had some questions and they seemed to field them accurately."}

This place is awesome!!\\n\\nWe got a breakfast buffet entry for 17$ each at 10:45AM. The lunch buffet was starting at 11AM and the girl at billing counter was sweet enough to suggest us to enter now and sit through both breakfast (17$) and lunch (24$) buffets, for the price of just the breakfast buffet!!\\n\\nI experienced the real BRUNCH for the first time, sitting through both breakfast and lunch buffets :D\\n\\nThe service is prompt with people coming in for coffee refills, drinks orders, and clearing up the table after every helping. \\n\\nThe buffets - huge variety of EVERYTHING you can think of....salads, soups, appetizers, pastas, pizzas, breads, dips, cheese, paninis, pancakes, cakes, pastries, eggs, potatoes, meats, rice.....cuisines included American, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, French, Japanese...and so on...\\nDuring the lunch buffet they opened a completely new section JUST FOR DESSERTS!!! I went crazy just looking at the tempting colors and presentation of the desserts. These were for everyone, gelatos and sugar free desserts for the diet conscious,  and chocolate candies, fruits, and brownies for the chocoholics.\\n\\nCould barely walk after hogging both meals at the same time but it was an experience to remember!!!\\n\\nSmart tip - Go to wicked spoon with a growling tummy around 10:30AM :D"}

{"label":1,"text":"Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world. \\n\\nThe space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. \\\"Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!\\\" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.\\n\\nThe service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee. \\n\\nThe sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.\\n\\nSorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience."}
{"label":3,"text":"I really do just love this place...from the very first time I set foot. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my friend and I waited for about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded.\\nI recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!"}
{"label":3,"text":"\\\"No Knife Needed\\\"\\n\\nIf you're a fan of true southern cuisine make sure you check out Mamma's Boy Cafe.  I just enjoyed smothered pork chops, mac & cheese and greens. The chops were true to their name, not fried and dipped in gravy like some other \\\"soul food\\\" establishments.  These chops were truly smothered in a killer gravy, seasoned to perfection and were so tender I only needed my fork to cut into them; reminded me of my grandmother's cooking.  Needles to say, I will be a regular and I'm looking forward to exploring their menu.  Kudos to the owner and his team!"}

I noticed that the waiter only asked us how we would like our eggs but not our steak also. That's a red flag. And my sharp poker intuition didn't disappoint me. The ribeye was maybe half an inch thick BEFORE cooking since it was like a quarter inch when it came out. It was cooked well done and tasted like a ribeye I guess... It came with hash browns, eggs, and toast.\\n\\nPro-tip: This would have probably tasted better after a night of drinking"}
{"label":1,"text":"I finally stopped into this place after seeing it every first Friday and when heading to Amsty. The inside is cute but it has an unusual smell, I think it's from the bathrooms. :( the decor is cute and the bathrooms themselves look very nice. It's a pretty small place and it has a cute little bar. My friend and I ordered the calamari which was different, just seemed like they tried too hard. Calamari is good it's usual way, anywho, I enjoyed it here. We ordered the Sakura roll and it was good but that's it. I'm a big sushi person and although the Sakura was good, it just didn't do it for me. The presentation of the food is nice so I give them an A there... The service was pretty good as well...\\n\\nI don't know of many sushi places downtown so this one is a pretty okay place. I know there is one in the AZ center that I need to try soon :)"}
{"label":2,"text":"My wife went there recently during the week with a few friends. It was a Monday afternoon. She said it was not what she expected. It was a neat experience but not as many animals as she thought. 10 bucks to get in for locals and that seemed kinda steep after she got in and realized how minimal the park was.  Also it was over 100 degrees and there was not a drop of water to be had. Every water fountain she stopped at....it said out of order.  This is very dangerous for visitors. They should have water available st all times."}
{"label":3,"text":"This is a very Ikea-type place, but in the best possible way.\\n\\nFirst off, no floral patterns or nasty ruffled bed covers anywhere!  The property opened in early 2009 so everything is new, clean, and does not have any peculiar smells like most hotels do.  The rooms are spacious with comfy beds, flat screen TVs and glass shower stalls. The toiletries are from the same Bliss collection as you would find at higher priced parent chain. \\n\\nAnother shocker -- the bottle of water in the room is complimentary!!!  It's the small things that count; I am unfortunately used for that little bottle to be $5.  Also, free wired and wireless internet throughout the property, a 24\/7 gym, a (tiny) pool, a bar, and a little snack area. Minimalistic modern design, funky music, and trippy floor panels in the elevators. The hotel is located right in the Epicenter so you're within crawling distance of all the hopping clubs and restaurants as well as the office buildings where you need to drag your sorry a$$ in the morning. \\n\\nFinally, the nightly rate is about $40-$50 cheaper than any other property in the surrounding few blocks.\\n\\nThe reason I took off one star is the loud beast of an A\/C system in the room that is hard to tame (there's digital control for the unit but it's pretty finicky).  But a little birdy told me that they're going to replace all air conditioning units due to high number of complains.\\n\\nBottom line: this girl will be back -- I stayed in other hotels in the area and this one, though not perfect, is the best for my taste and a bargain too!"}

{"label":1,"text":"Located on The Las Vegas Strip. Yes, it's big and shiny, but I am not a particular fan of Aria or City Center in general. I will give a few reasons. The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}

They've got a La Marzocco Linea and a serious group of grinders - Mazzer Robur, Elecktra Nina, and Two Compak K10s - they mean business. \\n\\nI had a double espresso - described as a Papua New Guinea single origin with citrus and berry flavors.  It was pulled more of a traditional volume at 2oz+, but I was getting a little sweetness with some earthy flavors.  They have a couple of espresso bean options, so trying others might have found one a little more to my liking. My dad had a latte, which was pretty good - maybe the coffee works better in milk.\\n\\nThe barista was friendly and open to talk about the coffee, which was nice.  They roast on site, which is a plus too.  The place has a lot of potential, so it will be interesting to see what they do in the future."}

{"label":4,"text":"One of the best buffets of my life. No joke. Line was long for it, so that's a good sign but that's the case with all Vegas buffets. It's about $50 a head on Saturdays for dinner. Good selection of many things. Highlights for me include: freshly cut prime rib, medium rare with a great crust. Leg of lamb. Crab legs already split for you, no cracking necessary. It's crack-a-lacking. Truffle Risotto. Macarons. Gelato. Bone marrow. Shrimp and grits. Shrimp cocktail and ceviche. Everything else was really good and very un-buffet like but those were the star attractions for me personally. Obviously it's not for everyone and it depends on your taste buds. It seems they offer things seasonally or only once in a while so not everything is always the same each time you come. I had so much seafood and prime rib that I got my money back in my belly in no time and then some! Great buffet, I can't wait to come back and try some of the other Vegas buffets but thus far, one of the best for me."}
{"label":4,"text":"To begin with it bears saying that this is a special treat location for vegans, where there are vegan options for almost all items.  A variety of milk alternatives (rice, almond, etc.) are available, contrasted with many places which offer only soy milk.\\n\\nThe house coffee blend (what you get when you order, say, an ice coffee) is one of the best coffees I've ever had.  Given that this is just their house blend, their specialty coffees are something really special indeed.\\n\\nFor food I ate their tofurkey 'wich, which was pretty good.  Definitely a tasty lunch snack.  Their 'NomNom' burrito was the best breakfast burrito my girlfriend had ever eaten.  For avocado lovers out there, when they say there is avo on something, they do Not skimp.\\n\\nOn top of their great food and drink, the help is knowledgeable and friendly.  We sat and had fun conversations and felt really welcomed by Mike.  The decor of the shop is modern but not cold, and the atmosphere is very calm, low key.\\n\\nWhether you're in a rush and need to just pick up a great tasting coffee, or want to lounge for a while and sip, Sunrise Coffee is an excellent choice even if you have to head a bit out of the way."}
{"label":1,"text":"I feel hungover and the guilt of being underage just by walking by this place.  Unless I'm super drunk to begin with, I'm probably not venturing in.\\n\\nOn another note, I gave this a second star because I hear they have (or used to have) a stock market pricing system where drinks cost more or less based on demand.  It's the only way I've ever really understood the economy, and that combined with the fact that they serve alcohol, merits two proud stars."}
{"label":2,"text":"I took my parents for restaurant week, as they just moved to the area. We waited 45 minutes for a table, even with a reservation.

If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.\\n\\nBut this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.\\n\\nThe prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.\\n\\nAnyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!"}
{"label":2,"text":"Finally broke my Bacchanal Buffet virginity, and I'm sad to say that this place has been over hyped.. Or maybe I just had too high of a standard for this place because of everyone's reviews about it. \\n\\nMy family and I went during dinner - around 3pm, so there was almost no wait time. Walking in, I thought this place was quite impressive. The decoration was beautiful. I've never seen a buffet decorated like this! \\n\\nWe got seated, told the waiter our drink order, and left to get food. \\n\\n--- 1st serving: \\n\\n- Lo Mein noodles: Pretty yummy. Just the way I love my Asian noodles to taste like! Noodles weren't dry and it was pretty flavorful. \\n- Salmon Nigiri: Can I just say.. YUM?! The salmon was nice and buttery. It tasted so good and fresh! But can I just say that the rice tasted TOO vinegary for my liking.\\n- Kalbi ribs: Ehhh... Taste was yummy and very bbq-y BUT the meat was rubbery :( that killed it for me.\\n- Edamame: Pretty good; wish it had a little bit more flavor to it though.\\n- Penne alla vodka: HOLY YUM. I wish I got more of this, but I wanted to try bits and pieces of everything before I got insanely full. \\n\\n--- 2nd serving:\\n\\n- Oysters & crab legs: Mmm, my favorite seafood ever. So good! Though I wish the crab legs were a bit more meaty though. The ones at the Carnival buffet at Rio had more meat and were a bit more flavorful than the ones here.\\n- Beer-battered shrimp: Not my favorite.. And I LOVE BEER. I was expecting these to taste like heaven but the shrimps were too overcooked so the meat stuck to the shell. I don't know about you, but I want to eat ALL of my shrimp meat.\\n- Cocktail shrimp: I prefer the ones at the Carnival buffet better. Sure the shrimps here were ginormous but the flavor was not.\\n- Corn on the cob: BEST CORN OF THE COB. HANDS DOWN. \\n\\nAs for the dessert, THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PART! It was like every single item I got was a little part of heaven going into my mouth. So good! \\n\\n--- Service: I thought the service was poor :( They took forever to get the plates off of our table. Not to mention they also failed to refill our drinks. I don't know if I'm spoiled or what, but I like it when my server is pro-active. They see an empty glass, they refill it. Simple as that right? I don't have to sit in my chair for an extra 5-10 minutes just looking around and waiting for ANY server to pass by just so I can get a refill of my peach iced tea. I understand that they get busy, but don't neglect your guests in the process of that for 20 almost 30 minutes sometimes! \\n\\nAnyway, I would go back.. If I won the lottery. This place is WAY TOO overpriced. $200 for 4 people for Saturday dinner. Yeah. OVERPRICED. When I could go to Carnival buffet for HALF of that price AND eat amazing quality foodies!"}

{"label":1,"text":"Souper Salad always leaves you slightly dissatisfied. Not that I believe the competition is much better but there are some definite improvements that could push Souper Salad up a few notches. \\n\\n1. Clean plates and silverware. - we typically are left sorting through the stack of plates to look for one without cling on leftovers. This goes for silverware as well.\\n\\n2. More adequate staffing. - Every time we have gone to Souper Salad (which is quite often) we are forced to wait at the register for 2 - 10 minutes while the floor attendant carries drinks to seated patrons and removes dirty trays. There is one lady who has been working here forever with long brown hair. She seems to take on the majority of the workload. This last weekend there was what appeared to be a younger lady manager who seemed very uninterested in assisting at the register or anywhere else for that matter.\\n\\n3. Bread station refills - The bread is almost always empty or near empty forcing you to watch until bread is set out and then battle the other customers to get a lousy breadstick.\\n\\nI noticed that Souper Salad recently attempted a minor facelift. While under \\\"construction\\\" the place looked a bit like a crime scene and I half expected a chalk outline on the floor. The big reveal did not do much to make up for the cosmetic disarray. There were maybe a few new pictures added (no more creepy dancing veggies) but I didnt notice many upgrades other than that. Regardless, you get what you pay for and considering you can feed a family of 3 for less than $20 you can't expect 5 star dining, but I won't be giving Souper Salad a 5 star rating either."}

The fish was generously and perfectly cut.  I'm usually not a fan of tuna, but the tuna was so delicious, I ate lots of it.  Obviously I stuffed myself with salmon and yellowtail nigiri.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure I gained 20lbs after gobbling up everything."}
{"label":2,"text":"UGH. How many Chicos, Victorias Secrets, and Zumiez could one suburban town possibly need?! I had such high hopes for DT Summerlin, and thought it would be laid out more like The Grove or Century City in LA, with pretty outdoor walkways, places to sit in the SHADE, and new and interesting shops or stalls. NOPE. The center driveway is for cars much like the District in GV now is, and there are no covered awnings or benches (which are made out of metal btw- LOL), so summer shopping should be a blast when it's 110 degrees. It actually had more of a vibe of an outlet mall, very sparse and dry. The two department stores, Dillard's and Macy's are on the far end of the largest parking lot, and Macy's looks like an old dilapidated department store, not one that just opened. \\n\\nThe walkways in between the stores are interesting, it's almost like the mall is cut in half and you have to go down an alley to get to the other side of the shops to see what you might have missed. The only restaurant open when I was there was Crave, which had a 2 hour wait, but other than that I think the only two additions will be CPK and Wolfgang Puck. The Nordstrom Rack, ULTA, Trader Joes etc. is on the OPPOSITE side, which is both good and bad. If someone just wants to go grocery shopping and run into NR, they can pull into that lot and not make a mess of navigating the mall, but if you are out shopping for the day, you'd have to move your car. \\n\\nI'll only return for Nordstrom Rack..."}
{"label":1,"text":"I just started working at a corporate office in Scottsdale Quarter and tried out C3 on my second week. \\n\\nI have to say I was not impressed on any level.\\n\\nWell, that's not entirely true. The one level that was SUPER impressed about was this. There is a guy who takes orders and he was amazing. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and watched as he helped everyone in front of me with all kind of questions, issues, and orders. and He was hilarious when it was my time to order since it was my first time in the restaurant. I wish I would have caught his name to give him more kudos. \\n\\nOther than that though, I could give this place a C-. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich. My co workers salad arrived probably 20 + minutes after we ordered and my sandwich was nowhere in sight. After ten more minutes I went in to ask and was told \\\"its coming its coming hold on.\\\" five minutes later it showed up, soggy and extremely disappointing. I ate three bites, and decided to call it quits. My co workers salad looked delicious but I have no idea if it was or not. \\n\\nOverall, eh."}

They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!"}
{"label":1,"text":"I remember when I used to sit with proprietor David L. at Biltmore C.P. (not CPK, you freak) and listen to him get passionate about this modular bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively. Willo Bread was born.\\n\\nI also remember when I was little going to My Florist for FLOWERS. Over the years, the strip mall saw many tenants come and go and seemingly at just the right moment, David picked up one of the suites and began his bakery project. After its extreme success with local AJ's and \\\"fine\\\" restaurants around town, he expanded to the old flower shop (converting it to a restaurant), its loft overhead and the adjoining suite for the grocery.\\n\\nPerhaps it was my third visit that was the one I shan't forget. I am a pianist and have played professionally here and there over the years. After hearing just one selection by SAVANT [Nicole?] I was so discouraged I resolved never to play again. I hate her (not really) for being so good. Try going up to talk to her and you'll see what I mean. She's clearly multi-tasking on 7 or 8 different threads, one of which is to talk with you. I've seen her on the phone while playing with one hand, reaching out to the nearby table while playing with one hand, totally looking the opposite direction for minutes at a time, and more. Total Savant.\\n\\nShe easily has the entire repertory of all music in her head, but for her it is not the music itself, but the concepts of the music from which she plays. She can play the entire soundtrack from Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. It's uncanny. Ask her to play a classical piece, and only because you know the exact note order, phrases and timings do you realize that she's pretty close, but not exact. Who cares? She could play against Mozart in dueling pianos and he'd end up on the floor gasping in and out of a paper bag.\\n\\nAt some point David bought her a concert Steinway, well deserved.\\n\\nOther than the place where [name?] played during her lifetime, My Florist will have no other mark on the history of Phoenix. To those of us still alive wishing we could add our own marks on history, our screaming and YELLING about the poor service, useless bartenders and ridiculous menu will be but whispers against her virtuosity. But let me make my attempt.\\n\\nSeeing my favorite bottle of gin on the shelf, I ordered my martini: \\\"Sapphire martini, straight up, stirred (!!!) with a twist\\\". What came back was a brown thing that looked like chocolate milk. \\\"Oh, I thought you ordered an espresso martini.\\\" Tell me, does Sapphire sound like \\\"espresso\\\" to you? My answer is... only to someone who has NO CLUE about what a real martini is. Do me a favor and don't insult the reputation of Bombay Sapphire: please instead display and serve Gordon's.\\n\\nAfter a recent performance of the Arizona Broadway Theater, we joined the cast as they gathered for a late dinner and drinks. After the 25 of us ate and drank, we spent the next 55 minutes (no joke) figuring out the bill because they couldn't split the check, not even in half. forGET it! (don't you forget CASH -- in small denominations -- if you're going with a group).\\n\\nIf from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen, mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu, it's because you can: the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate, the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish, and the same bread (yes, it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning), is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is.\\n\\nNot to say that the bread isn't good. Just know that when bread is made this way (without all the nasty chemicals and preservatives), and then is exposed to AIR, it gets hard. Eat it within a few hours of being baked. My advice is to go to the grocery first thing when it opens and try to get one of the 4 willowich sandwiches available daily (scrumptious ham, cheese, basil and add vinaigrette) before they go. You'll have to beat me, so get up early."}
{"label":1,"text":"What a disappointment. I have lived in the area for a few years now I was hoping to get a new bar\/restaurant that would price itself for the neighborhood. Sadly, the prices for food are so high, and the return for your dollar so low it is just not worth going there no matter how good the food is, and it wasn't (that good). I do not foresee a long run of business for these people here.\\n\\nWalking in was like walking into a dungeon, very dark and honestly you could trip over things. Since this was formerly a Timbers, the d\\u00e9cor was that \\\"North Western\\\" hack you expect from a Timbers, nothing interesting. The bar had  the requisite Video Poker games and what looked to be a shallow well. The Spirits list included some very pricey bottles (including Dom at $400) that I would suppose would never sell in this neighborhood. The wines were an eclectic list and priced rather high, so not sure who they buy from but it is off beat. As for beers, well, I worked at a bar that had 700 different beers and was not impressed. I think the Smiths Ale was the only eye raiser. Also in there list was a subsection \\\"cans\\\", I have never seen this even though it is common for British Cream Ales and such to come in cans, it's not mentioned. So the bar area, nothing special and a bit eerie, but that's my opinion.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant, the prices were too high, period. The claim made by the waiter (this had to have been his first service job) that all the food was fresh made was a complete lie. The food was Sysco re-heat and eat restaurant selections without a doubt. Of the burger dinner I did have, MAYBE the patty was hand formed and 1\/3 pound. It came with sweet potato fries (undercooked) and fried pickle chips on the burger (so they  were soggy), and the bacon tasted reheated by dropping it in the fryer for  a few seconds. This was $14.\\n\\nMy wife wanted Linguini Alfredo and it came with garlic bread. This also was $14. Yeah, that's all, pasta (not fresh), Alfredo Sauce (if that was made fresh then there is something seriously wrong with the cook) and of course they weren't about to bake bread. But are we missing something? Where is the protein? This did not come with a protein, they want you to pay extra for a protein or even some vegetables. $14 for a plate of carbs... and worse, they didn't really have any. Was there a fish offering? No. How about adding chicken to that Alfredo? Nope. Shrimp? What's that? And this was the same for the red sauce, (no bolognaise  from what I could see).\\n\\nWell, won't be back unless management changes again."}

I do remember eating there, but it wasn't bad enough to complain about or good enough to remember... until tonight. I ordered the Mac n Cheese and I think it's the best Mac n Cheese I've had anywhere. I ate until I couldn't eat anymore and enjoyed every bite. A variety of cheeses and baked to deliciousness.\\n\\nI sat on the north patio - away from the bar. The server was attentive and friendly right up til it was time for her to go off duty and she lost enthusiasm\/motivation but eventually came back for the check business.

I got the dabayou (sp?) double patty burger with Cajun sweet potato fries. Those were the best sweet potato fries that I have ever had! The burger was pretty tasty itself, not as big as I thought it would be but it was good enough for me and I shared it with someone. I also got the jazz hands float (vanilla frozen yogurt or you could choose to put vanilla ice cream, sprite, and chopped pieces of mango). Then me and 2 friends shared rediculous off the breakfast menu (more of a dessert....) which is a red velvet waffle with a lighter version of the cream cheese frosting, blackberries and raspberries, chocolate drizzle, bacon, and syrup on the side. The prize ranged but averaged I would say 10-15. Their smoothies were pretty expensive, about $10. Parking was decent. It's a small place, could probably fit like 30 people. \\n\\nAlso, they offer free hugs so I took up that offer and the cashier was nice and she gave me a hug and everyone else at my table decided to get a hug. The art on the inside of the restaurant is pretty cool as well. Service is awesome, people asked if it was out first time and it was since we were visiting from San Diego so one of the guys explained the menu to us (so many options!). People checked in with us and served the food to us. You pay at a register then you get your food so you don't have to worry about paying afterwards or how to split a check! :)"}

{"label":4,"text":"I had the pleasure of staying at this newly built, modern design with french flair location for 3 nights and 4 days. My only and biggest complaint is due to the location, construction, and one ways. This hotel can be a pain in the butt to get to.  Aside from that, everything else I can think of was excellent. My fiancee says that this is a Starwood chain and normally they are pretty expensive, but this is trying to be the hotel catered to the \\\"Budget minded\\\" traveler. \\n\\nDue to the age of the hotel everything is very new and clean. In the main common area upon walking in, there are nice couches, chairs, modern furniture, a fireplace in the bar area, a free billiards table, free wifi access, board games to play while you sit and relax, a led lighted bar with 3 flat screen tv's above, heated pool, up to date exercise equipment with hookups for your mp3\/ipod devices, 2 large screen computers for wired internet access, an ATM machine and various concessions available for purchase as well as bagged ice. \\n\\nGetting into the room there are many other perks that make staying here a good choice. Mini fridge, safe for valuables, coffee\/tea maker, complimentary bottled water. Digital hookup to the 42\\\" TV for your laptop and other electronic devices. A huge comfy bed, well lit room,  blackout curtains, a vast standing shower with large shower head, and the cutest little retro clock. I snapped a bunch of pictures but most of them don't really do the place justice. If you fly into Montreal and are looking for an affordable place to stay and want to still be close to the city (15 minute drive, not bad at all) I would recommend this place in spades.

The chips and salsa are a sizable quantity with no skimping on the salsa.\\n\\nThe burritos are alright, but I suggest to stick towards the tacos. The hot sauce is sufficiently hot. I've been stuck waiting a while for my meal a few times... maybe a suggestion, if anyone at Fuzzy's is watching this: If someone orders chips, maybe they can grab those first while waiting for the other meals to come out?\\n\\nAll in all, a good place to get a few tacos and chips.

{"label":2,"text":"First off - this review is only for the concert going experience. I don't think I've every actually eaten here, and don't really plan to. \\nI've been here quite a few times since I've lived here for concerts. I've actually been to this venue more than any other in town for concerts. \\nThe last concert I was here for was just this past Friday (Keane with Ingrid Michealson and FRAN HEALY from TRAVIS). The most recent time before this weekend was in October, so I can't really rate on that experience. I've never actually gone to a concert for the almost sole purpose of seeing an opening act (if you couldn't tell, I was there for Fran from Travis). The tickets for this venue usually cheaper than other places on the strip (these were $28 for GA...however, I paid over $15.00 in taxes and fees for each ticket). I've never encountered a completely sold out show, and the will call window is super easy and doesn't typically require an additional fee.\\nThe box office staff at HOB are great. Very friendly and very helpful, this was no exception. The ticket and front security are also efficient and pleasant. They don't seem to get too upset when you are waiting to get into a show. \\nThe only staff that aren't always good is the inside security. Often times they get a bit assertive about phones and cameras when their really is no need. However, I can see this as a good thing when people really are out of control...which I've seen a couple of times. As for a concert venue, I really think its odd that they have bathroom attendants. I am at a  standing room only concert where I paid $30 for a ticket...I don't really need a bathroom attendant...I guess its charm. The drinks are priced pretty typically for the strip. I had a 24oz Miller Light for around $8. \\nUsually the sound and lights are good. This past concert was not good. The first two acts everything seemed to go okay. But when Keane finally started (after what seemed an eternity) the sound was off, and it never really got clear into  the show. My biggest problems where that a) the staff didn't let us know there was technical issues, despite us being able to see they where having problems. b) they didn't get their stuff figured out  to make the sound better, leaving me (maybe I was the only one) with an incomplete feeling from the show. They finished their set, but I couldn't say I 100% enjoyed the show, despite being a fan. \\nIf I could I'd give a 3.5 because I've seen some amazing shows here. However, its going to be a 3.0 until I can get back to see they still have their act together."}

None of the pies looked particularly interesting; I went with the vegetarian.  It was basically a step above a Barro's supreme pizza as far as toppings are concerned.  The crust was better than what you would get at a pizza chain, but it was a little harder than it should be, and somewhat lacking in flavor.\\n\\nNothing seems particularly bad, just underwhelming.  Not to mention, it cost almost $20 for a pizza and a drink.

They're a bit like the ones at the Luxor except I paid way more for them and they're not quite as large. The room service ain't great either as it took them forever to get it to us. \\n\\nThe Buffet used to be great and now it's merely good and probably a little over-priced. They've got a Cinnabon, which is awesome as when I'm taking a Casino for a bunch I enjoy celebrating with a tasty cinnamon bun. It was a tasty way to end my night. \\n\\nThe Casino is old and full of family gambling types and other Casino employees. It's actually a pretty good crowd to play with. The Texas Hold-'Em table game is the best one on the Strip without question. Their Blackjack has the surliest dealers I've seen in ages and that's a good thing if you're just there to play hand after hand without too much chatter. I love those types of dealers once in a while. \\n\\nThe staff tends to be good, though not on the level of the Luxor or New York, New York."}

Hoping it was an oversight by a new Ahwatukee business, we ordered again and mentioned the lack of pepperoni on our first order.  They apologized and said they would pass the message along.  A lot of good that did - pretty sure we had even less pepperoni the second time.  There is absolutely nothing special about this pizza.  It's expensive (comparable to Spinatos or Oreganos), but the same quality as a fast-food pizza chain.  Save your money and order from Dominos or Papa Johns - they actually taste better.  Want good pizza?  Go to Spinatos or Oreganos."}

It tasted about par with other places though.\\n\\nGyoza: I always thought they were different (but similar) to Chinese dumplings but here, it was EXACTLY like a Chinese dumpling.

What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.

Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   \\n\\nAnother reason not to go there is not their fault.

{"label":0,"text":"I was excited about visiting a new Indian restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh that is in close proximity to my office, but this lunch buffet visit of Monday, 22 September 2014 was a great disappointment.  I received a pleasant greeting and a 'thank you' from the owner.  The busser did not interact with me. No one performed a quality check or did anything to be assured of my satisfaction. Used plates were taken away promptly and I received a water refill without having to ask.  I agree with the writer who said that the place was too hot; this was the case even on a cool day. I had perspiration running down my neck while dining. Beware the dish which contains microscopic particles that appear to resemble broccoli and cauliflower as it is very spicy.  The only vegetable that could be readily identified in it is a few carrot slices.  I was hoping to find the staple Indian dish, aloo gobi, but it was not offered.  There was a dish which featured only potato slices and the cauliflower offered in the vegetable dish was not enough to satisfy any diner.  I arrived at 12:45, which should be the height of lunch hour.  There were only two diners there at that time, although a few other parties arrived during the short time I was there.  The buffet items had obviously been sitting out for a long time.  The white rice, which I was pleased to find was unadulterated by any seeds or seasoning, was in small quantities of clumps.  Many of the dishes needed to be replenished, but only the fried vegetable dish was during the time that I was there.  The signs denoting the names of the dishes are do not enable the American customer to determine their ingredients.  The tandoori chicken was quite tasty; I can only imagine how good it would have been if it had at least been served warm.  India Palace and Indian Spices on Sixth Street are far better choices for the Indian food lover, and Indian Spices is 58 cents less for the lunch buffet!"}

And when the food and drinks are sub-par, aloof personnel just doesn't cut it. Not my first visit, but this was likely the last.\\n\\nMy hubby and I prefer chilling at the bar rather than table service, so we grabbed a couple of stools and settled in on a slow Thursday night for a bite and a beer. The place - bar and table area - was pretty dead, yet it still took at least 5 minutes to grab the bartender. Ok fine, maybe they just wrapped up the dinner rush or something. We order beers and ask for a food menu, taking note of a particularly icy demeanor slapping menus in front of us. But again, not here to make a new friend, so it's cool. Then as we try to get her attention to order, she seems to be avoiding our area. As she makes her way around the bar, grabbing empty glasses and cleaning the counter tops, she is finally within earshot. So I meekly ask \\\"could we order an entree as well?\\\" to which she replies, \\\"I'll be with you in just a minute\\\" and proceeds to wipe down the counter and bus dishes. Is it just me or is there some kind of invisible line that invisible people are waiting it to grab a seat at the bar? I could understand clearing up as a priority when there are patrons waiting to sit and I'd happily exercise patience to allow other people an ejoyable sit, but by now it's 9pm....and it's really dead inside. So....ok we waited for her to finish cleaning. And then ordered.\\n\\nAccording to my other half, the rubber chicken sandwich was passable only as a means to slicene hunger pangs. It left his tastbuds rather underwhelmed and waistline rather remorseful with an excess of bread. Has anyone noticed how strange it is for a bar of this size not to have any beer on tap? I've had a few other appetizers on previous visits, but nothing memorable.

{"label":4,"text":"I had always thought  that Craftsteak is the best steakhouse before i visited Jean Goerges.  I had such a great experience at this place i would really recommend it to everyone who visits Las Vegas. I like everything here from the ambiance, the service, to the food.  \\n\\nThe dishes are exciting, amusing, and just dances on your tastebuds.  The chef (Robert Moore, former executive chef at Prime, Bellagio), creates dishes that really allow the quality of the ingredients to stand out. The presentation of the creations here are both elegant and rustic without being overly extravagant, inviting you to savor every bite.\\n\\nWe shared the salt and pepper sweetbreads and crispy shrimp for appetizers and they were both delicious.  I had the filet mignon and it was just as good as it gets.  The black truffle and comte fritter side dish was real fun and delicious the same time. I do not recollect the taste of the sauces that came with the steak...i believe by that point of the dinner my senses got carried away to the clouds with the champagne.\\n\\nA highly recommended steakhouse indeed ;)"}
{"label":3,"text":"The location for this place is great, although the property could build a better straight shot pedestrian walkway TO the Strip.  Instead you have to walk all the way around OR through High Roller's HOT parking lot.  \\n\\nLots of pools, a small market, clean and SPACIOUS villas, etc.  It's everything a resort should offer - definitely meets expectations there!  \\n\\nA couple bad things: \\n- I specifically asked to have a view and be in a quiet room (I forgot they were villas with individual entrances).  She put us in Building 19 for a \\\"view\\\" of the pool - which added a 7 minute walk each time we ventured out to the strip.  You may wonder why we walked?  Because the Operator\/Concierge REFUSED to send a taxi to our building. \\n- Speaking of taxis, they REFUSED to call ahead for us.  We had dinner reservations (that we've had for 2 months) at 6pm one night.  We called at 5:03pm and asked to have a taxi waiting for us at 5:45pm.  They refused to do so.  So my husband went up early to call for one at 5:25pm.  I got up there at 5:53pm and the taxi was STILL not there.  We missed the reservation and had to BEG to \\\"get in\\\".  ONLY to find out, the Bell Desk walkies the other Bellman who stands at the entrance of the resort to wave-in taxis!!  WHAT TOOK SO LONG!?? \\n- With the above in mind, they wouldn't call ahead a taxi for the airport either.  But they did say there is a complimentary shuttle to take us and that all we would need to do is call to arrange it.  So, we followed instruction only to discover that the shuttle is not complimentary, it's not private, and the shuttle servicers are quite the assholes too (likely because we were misinformed and we wasted their time). \\n- The water.  Stay away from the water.  I am sure it's \\\"clean\\\", but Vegas water tastes like shit.  \\n- Lastly and the most terrible was the thumping on Saturday morning!!  At 9am, we were rudely greeted by the loudest thumping I've ever heard.  I called and it was due to Building 21 is doing maintenance.  Really?  These people are working while I am supposed to be enjoying my vacation??  They really cannot wait on that specific project until 11am?  \\n\\nOnto the \\\"time share\\\" portion of our trip.  I personally thought it was a great experience!  ALL of our representatives were excellent!  Danny, the tour guide, was the sweetest, most informative guy ever! Youness & Christopher were awesome as well!  Although, we didn't decide to buy a time share at that very moment, we still learned a lot and know we have one more opportunity to decide!"}

There are unique sculptures that are scattered about the park and fun road signs pointing to random yet creative destinations.  The park is a fun place to take your kids after some ice-cream to run some sugar out of their systems or to walk hand in hand with your significant other while the sun is beating down.

{"label":1,"text":"Our third visit and, because we want this local restaurant to do well, I must offer some constructive criticism.\\nFirst visit, very tasty food, prepared by Chef Wes.\\nSecond visit, still no complaints.\\nLast night, very disappointed.\\nMy husband ordered shrimp tagliatelle with alfredo sauce. True alfredo contains nothing but butter, cream and cheese.  This alfredo was like wallpaper paste. I'm guessing they must thicken it with flour in a poor attempt at a roux. Very gluey and raw tasting. Suggestion, cook the roux a bit longer before adding milk, then add some cream.\\nI ordered tagliatelle with olive oil, roasted garlic, broccoli and mushrooms.  When I got the dish, the veggies had burned and the taste was awful. The chef graciously apologized and made another. Very mediocre at best. This was dry and the veggies had been heated in a fry pan. I suggest they heat in some chicken broth before adding to a pasta dish.  I also suggest that when olive oil is chosen as the sauce, perhaps saute the garlic in the oil \\\"aglia olia\\\" then add rest of ingredients.\\nI read some poor reviews on the garlic knots. Ours were very flavorful with oil garlic and salt, but the insides were a bit raw.\\nI noticed that they use culinary students in the kitchen, perhaps for prepping?\\nMarinara sauce has good potential. Just a bit on the sweet side. I think the best bet for sauce is their tasty pesto.\\nThe ordering area is a bit confusing. There is a small blackboard on the wall, but the script writing is so tiny, it's almost impossible to read. Suggestion: Put a large blackboard on the back wall, near soda, and write in large print so people can see it when they come in. I did see on the board Lasagna $18.00. No way, that's the price in a fine dining restaurant.\\nThe chef who prepared our first meal wasn't there last night. The other chef is such a nice young man and, as I said, we want him to do well. \\nStill no beer and wine, and the macaroons are still tiny.\\nMost positive asset, the freshly made pasta is light and delicious.\\nNot trying to be mean, just constructive. I think when this little place \\\"gets the kinks out\\\" they'll do well!\\nReviewed by retired cooking teacher\/caterer (of Italian descent)"}
{"label":1,"text":"Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal."}

My cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapenos was good, it tasted like something you'd make at home. The fries were terrible. Not sure how they've earned such recognition. I like crisp fries, these were flimsy and greasy, and I wasn't a fan of cajun seasoning, either. Overall, I stand by In-N-out."}
{"label":0,"text":"This was the single worst car purchase experience of my life.  Some time ago I purchased a new 3 series from Chapman BMW.  When I received the warranty wallet card in the mail I noticed the \\\"in service\\\" date was wrong, and was dated 6 months prior to my purchase.  I called BMW to correct what I thought was a simple clerical problem, and was informed that my dealer had \\\"punched\\\" the car as in-service 6 months before I purchased it and that the warranty period would run from that date.  As a result of that action I didn't receive the well advertised full duration warranty and included maintenance...I received 6 months less.  Every page of the purchase documents were marked as a new car purchase, not a \\\"Demo\\\" and not a \\\"Used\\\" car.  The salesman even went to great lengths to tout the warranty and maintenance during the test drive.\\n\\nAfter endless letters to the dealer and escalating this to BMW of America there was no satisfactory resolution.  BMW North America refused to stand up for the full warranty period and simply shoved me back to the dealer.  After much back and forth, Chapman sent me a letter promising they would honor the remaining 6 months warranty and maintenance.  When I asked what would happen if I moved out of state, they simply repeated that they would cover the warranty for 6 months, but could not extend that to other dealers.\\n\\nAfter some research on the internet I learned that some less ethical dealers (like Chapman) \\\"punch\\\" cars to record them as in service (even though they have never been sold) so that they can collect dealer rebates from BMW.\\n\\nAltogether a horrific buying experience.  I have since bought 2 additional BMW vehicles (an X5 and Z4), but from BMW North Scottsdale, where the sales process is honest and straightforward."}
{"label":2,"text":"I was also duped by the BBQ Chicken logo....it's the same logo used by the BBQ Korean Fried Chicken place in Irvine, CA.  Not the Korean fried chicken I was hoping for but the chicken skin is as crispy as it's going to get in Vegas and the meat is moist.  I've been spoiled by Bon Chon and UFC on the east coast....so it doesn't quite compare, but it will meet my chicken cravings until I can escape to another city.  They have two flavors of their fried chicken...the spicy sauce version and the regular fried chicken.  Obviously the spicy sauce makes the skin a little less crisp...so I would say go with the original.  The rest of the korean food is pretty typical (Korean seafood pancake, spicy rice rolls, etc).  \\n\\nSo in terms of fried chicken, good for Vegas...not so good if you're coming from Cali or east coast."}

{"label":1,"text":"I want to start off by saying that the participating restaurants weren't to blame for what was wrong with this event - the tacos were all delicious. My problem with the event was that it was extremely disorganized. \\n\\nIt was damn near impossible to get a drink or to stand in the shade or to even get into the place. I tried not to hold a grudge on the line to get in, but holy hell. It was all enough to discourage me from coming back. If this was the first Taco Festival, I'd be more understanding. I'll bet the layout made total sense before they let people come inside. They need to check out a few Tempe Town Lake events to see how it's done.\\n\\nThere were several Valley events running concurrent with this one (like Tour de Fat)... Next year I may do something else. Overall though, I'm glad I went. I was able to sample some really tasty tacos. The offerings from Vitamin T, Cien Agaves, and Blanco's were excellent. We didn't have a single bad taco actually - can't recall every place we tried, but it was all good. \\n\\nI probably will go again at some point because I love tacos and I love to support good local restaurants, but I'm not in a hurry."}

The mister got the chicken piccatta and we ordered dipping sauces ( marinara\/alfredo) for the bread.  I also ordered the minestrone soup and Caesar salad.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was good- they were a little heavy handed with the dressing but at least it did not taste like the caesar in a bottle- tasted almost homemade with a slight anchovy flavor.\\nMinestrone soup was also okay- had plenty of vegetables, beans and was not too salty.\\nMy spaghetti and meatballs was, well, spaghetti and meatballs- something I could've made at home.  The meatballs were nice and moist but had an odd flavor to me, tasted like they seasoned it with alcohol or something but it was fine after a few bites.\\nThe mister's chicken piccatta was actually pretty good, plenty of mushrooms and capers.

{"label":4,"text":"I have a love hate relationship with roller coasters.  I go through a set of emotions every single time I ride them. Stage one: complete and utter excitement run through my veins when I'm in line, making it impossible for me to stay still or be quiet.  Stage two: silence, regret, fear, and locked knees as I near the very front of the line, to the point where I legitimately want to get out of the line and chicken out. Stage three: pale, white face as the ride starts, kicking myself for getting onto the ride and not chickening out earlier. Stage four: the best time of my life as I free fall, ride through loops, spirals, drops.  Stage five: wanting to go again after stepping off the ride!\\n\\nNow as you can imagine, going through this routine every time is very emotionally draining but the NYNY Roller Coaster totally makes it worth it!  I've been to Six Flags about five times, so I've been exposed to some pretty awesome roller coast rides.  But this roller coaster in Vegas is still able to wow me!  It has everything I enjoy, the crazy fall in the beginning, loops that fly you upside down, spirals, mini drops, speed, and to top it all off, you get an amazing view of the strip.  It's a must to do this at night because the lights become a beautiful blur that really adds to the experience.\\n\\nThey have a few different ticket options.  You can pay for a one time ride for $14. And if you want to do a re-ride, there is a sign that says it's $7 as you leave the ride.  Or you can get an all day, unlimited pass for $25.\\n\\nIt's a little difficult to find the roller coaster if you don't know where you're going.  You have to go  through all these twists and turns in the NYNY arcade.  Don't  worry about any bags or personal belongings.  They have lockers that require two quarters, and if you don't have change, there are change machines nearby in the arcade.\\n\\nDon't leave Vegas without doing this!  :)"}

It was tough getting the sandwich out of the styrofoam container, so I just ate it out of the cup with a spoon instead. No biggie.\\n\\nMy son got the rainbow sherbert with chocolate chip cookies. He loved the ice cream and his cookies were perfect -- chewy and moist. Perfect for taking a bite out of without the ice cream shooting out the back.

The paella was more of a risotto, but still tasty, and a HUGE serving considering it was a \\\"tapa.\\\"  The star of the evening was the plate grilled tacos, which came with jicama slaw, pico de gallo and some mango salsa, too, I believe.  Each component was delish and combined, the flavors all really worked together.  Sadly there were only 3 little tortillas (so there was lots of leftover filling, which we ate anyway).  I cold have eaten 10 of these! \\n\\nAnother nice surprise was the VERY reasonably-priced wine list! We had a nice bottle of garnacha to accompany our dinner, and it was only $28.  Several other choices under $30 as well! \\n\\nWe decided on the chocolate cake (served with a glass of rice milk) for dessert.  Way too full to each get our own!  It took quite awhile to arrive (I actually think our waiter forgot to put in the order), but we were enjoying our wine and a lovely evening on the patio, so no big.  The cake was also delish.  Molten on the inside, and the cool rice milk was a nice foil to the warm chocolate.  The texture of the cake was a little spongy and dry, but I would definitely order it again.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back and try more stuff!

We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus."}
{"label":3,"text":"I love the Neighborhood Theatre... it has kept me coming back for years.  From the Indigo Girls to DSO, the Brazilian Girls, North Mississippi Allstars, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, to my most recent show-- the Blue Dogs and Drivin N Cryin, this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show.  \\n\\nIt gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  \\n\\nThere are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.  I am fine to get my own PBR or-- the value cup!-- a big ole, in the case of this past weekend, Sierra Nevada.  Score!\\n\\nBathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait... probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you can...but, they do have a Dyson hand dryer (the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine!).  \\n\\nThis spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area.  It is truly local business at its finest.  It also really helped ramp up the music scene in Charlotte..."}

On my first visit I ordered a very delicious chicken salad that I ordered to go and was still hungry after eating and paying $11 for that and a drink. For my second visit, I received a SMALL cup of soup and chewy BLT with wimpy bread for $11.40. I'd rather go to Bytes across the street or Cedar St. to get more for my money."}

{"label":0,"text":"If I could give Meineke ZERO stars I totally would because they are sharks!.  So I hit a curb (this is a regular occurance I don't know why) and I needed to get a front end alignment so I thought.  I brought my car to this Meineke because it was close to my house and driving was getting pretty difficult.  When I called before I went over there I asked how much the alignment was and it was in the ball park of $90.  Ok, sweeet!\\n\\nNo, not sweet.  Sour.\\n\\nThey said it would take 2 hours JUST TO LOOK AT.  So I went over to Bilbo's and hung out there for a while.  Exactly two hours on the dot they call me to go back to Meineke.  They gave me an estimate of $1400 (no effing way) and said that my car was basically going to explode on me if I don't get the 4 things I needed fixed.  I was told that it was \\\"unsafe and possibly dangerous\\\" to drive my car.  Needless to say I didn't have $1400 on me, or even the \\\"minimum\\\" amount of what they were going to do which was $600.  I went home deflated :(\\n\\nThen my friend suggested Ted Wiens (who I will write another awesome yelp review about).....AND HOLY BANANAS WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Ted Wiens had my car up on their lot in like 45 minutes and was looking at it.  They even brought me out there to show me what was wrong (bent tire rod).  He said it will be like 2 hours to fix and the grand total?  $285.  Yes.  For Everything.  When I asked the guy about all the crap Meineke said I needed he literally said this: \\\"What?  Are you kidding?  Those A**holes have no idea what they are doing.:\\\"  He then proceeded to show me EVERY part on my car that Meineke said was \\\"so totally badly and completely damaged and unsafe\\\" and they were all fine.  Normal wear and tear.  No need to replace.  \\n\\nI think I hugged him.\\n\\nAnyway I just want everyone to know to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER in your life use this Meineke, they will try to get you to spend unnecessary money!"}

It took a while to order and then the order was not correct when it came to the table. The appetizer cinnamon roll never came, my drink was not refilled and my pancake was burnt (black).

{"label":2,"text":"The hotel over all is pretty good, but my only complaint was that my room had a bit of a strange odor.  The hotel is huge with several towers.  The casino has everything a gambling enthusiast might want; slots, tables, cards.  There are also a few restaurants inside tho they will cost you a pretty penny.  The pool is about average size, and I say this because we visited several other hotels while we were there and they seemed to have some bigger ones.  But I really did enjoy the swim up bar  If you are not too concerned about the view from your balcony, the price of the rooms is not too bad either, but watch out for the odor. In the end, I think this hotel is decent for the price that we paid."}

{"label":0,"text":"Must have been an off night cause this place was WICKED HORRIBLE!! I cannot beleive they have the balls to charge 35 dollars to eat here. Here are my problems with this place.\\n\\n1-Service - If you're going to charge 35 dollars a person, at least have a full time server. I had to pour my own water which is kept on the table along with the glasses. Also what the hell is up with keeping the wine bottle on the table with the glasses it takes up way too much space. If we didn't order it, clear it off the table (which is the size of a full sized pillow).\\n\\n2- Food- EVERYTHING WAS WAY TOO SALTY. Food stayed out way to long sometimes, so its not as fresh as it should be. Also way to slow on replenshing food. Plus the variety was poor too, not much to choose from. Bone Marrow bones were disgusting and not much of a salad selection. Also needs to redirest A\/C to not blow directly on table, makes hot food cold.\\n\\n3- Dessert- I didn't really have desert but my g\/f did. She likes to take 1 of each desert and try to see whats the best and she couldn't find one thing. Also we over heard the couple sitting next to us they said the dessert was not good.\\n\\nOverall this was the worst outing I have ever HAD...... PERIOD. I have never been so annoyed after eating at a buffet, you can usually find at least one thing that is good but not here. (I actually had to throw up afterwards). I will not be coming here again."}

{"label":2,"text":"I really really wanted to give this place a good review because honestly they have really good tart yogurt but the service has just been poor. If you're lucky, you can get in and out of the yogurt shop within 5-10min however, if there is just ONE more person than you, you might end up waiting for 20+min. When I went, there was only one lady in front of me and she ordered two smoothies. The worker took her order and immediately went to make her drinks without  even acknowleding me.. not even a \\\"I'll be right with you\\\". In addition, I also thought that you should take orders in batches and since I was right after her, I just assumed he could take my order also before going on to make it (just in case we had the same order so he could save time and make it double). \\nHowever, what really irritated me is that this guy took 15+min to make TWO smoothies. I know he really wanted to make the drinks as smooth as possible but c'mon! I'm not exactly sure how long it took him because I left after 15min. I might have waited if he acknowledged me but he didn't.... The wait must really suck if someone ordered a crepe.. sheesh!"}

I had to get out of my car in order to get someone's attention.   When I walked into the store I was hit in the face with the overpowering smell of Pinesol.

We had chicken wings (very juicy with great sauces), spinach artichoke asiago dip (thicker than we're used to but very tasty), and a wine burger with potato and sweet potato fries (delicious, cooked to order, and filling). Just right to get us going for the rest of the day. We'll be back!\\n\\nEdited to add: We have, in fact, been back a couple of times.

{"label":3,"text":"So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."}
{"label":3,"text":"This is one of our go-to inexpensive dinner places. Their margarita's are good and very large if you get anything but the small.

I had Filipino-style corned beef and potatoes and oxtail stew (\\\"kare-kare\\\"). Boy were they good. Small, homey place, in a busy strip mall in a Chinese plaza. Lots of other foodstuffs for sale. The name of this place means \\\"neighbor\\\", but literally it means \\\"house-connected\\\" - shows you that Filipinos have close ties to their neighbors, as a culture. Price is reasonable as $6.50 for two viands and rice."}
{"label":1,"text":"The review for two stars defines it as \\\"Meh. I've experienced better.\\\"  And I have.\\n\\nMy parents were in town, and a 20-page beer menu seemed as if it was going to be something that my father was going to enjoy (he's a beer guy).  I brew beer and have tasted most things on their menu at other places, so I was intrigued.\\n\\nI can't say that I've ever been more embarrassed to bring my parents to a Madisonian restaurant.\\n\\nTo start - the wait staff does nothing but stand there.  Four people behind the bar, all just chatting with each other.   I don't understand how a head of house doesn't understand table times, but apparently 35 minutes means an hour and ten minutes - all because they were watching a four top finish their meal and clean the table.  I live and work with plenty of restaurant people to know how to correctly estimate wait times, and putting a fifth chair on a four top should actually make your wait MUCH shorter.  Not so much.\\n\\nThe big thing about this place is the beer menu. The waitress didn't seem to have any knowledge of them whatsoever.  Also, she didn't seem very happy - she acted rather miserable as if waiting on us was an inconvenience.  Asking for an additional menu seemed to be a chore.  She came back to our table one time, because we called her over and asked for the check.  Once she dropped off the food she was nowhere to be seen again.\\n\\nThe menu is entirely unimpressive.  It's obvious that the place leans on it's extensive beer menu and doesn't care much for the people eating there (three waitresses vs. five bartenders).  That being said, the menu seemed appropriately short.  Do five things and do them well.  Not so.\\n\\nThe burger is a 1\/4 lbs. patty.  It's a $12, 1\/4 lbs. patty.  Not impressive.\\n\\nThe chicken is two sad pieces of cornish hen not dressed or sitting on anything colorful or inventive.\\n\\nThe steak is good, but you have to work really hard to mess up a steak.  Thus, two stars.  The brussel's sprouts were honestly some of the best i've ever had in my life, so they have that going for them.\\n\\nI felt as if our experience there was a side-show to sitting at the bar, and that the food is an afterthought - just like serving us.  Waiting for twice the estimated amount, slow service, an angry waitress, and clearly overpriced entrees that are meant to make guests feel as if they're getting more for their dollar - no.  It's not.  I work in the industry and I know when quality portions need to be kept small in order to keep costs reasonable.  NOTHING on the burger demanded $12.  As a joke, we went home and recreated four of them.\\n\\nIt cost us a total of $18 for all the ingredients.  It took ten minutes to shop, ten minutes to make.\\n\\nFor one of the best reviewed places on here, I think people are seeing what they hope to see - and after paying top dollar it's hard to admit that you've been cheated.\\n\\nI maintain no such illusions, whatsoever."}

The food was less than mediocre with numerous mistakes from the kitchen.  \\n2. Their fondue (a big reason for why we came) was terrible - poor quality chocolate, old accompaniments. \\n3. The servers were delivering plates to the wrong tables.\\n4. The atmosphere was confused, resembling what I can only describe as a cafeteria\/nightclub.\\n\\nI normally don't have such harsh judgements, but this place was really that bad.  My review is not just based on our night at the Sugar Factory, but what those around us were experiencing as well.  With the quality of service and food being less than par, unfortunately I will not be returning.  I really hope this poor experience is only true for their Town Square location.

{"label":1,"text":"So I've been here twice. First time I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss and some Smashfries. To go. It was alright. Wasn't overwhelmed - I was hungry and it hit the spot. Next time I came with some coworkers. We were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation. But that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food. This time I got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese burger. I know. Sounds pretty metrosexual but I was curious. I also got the Haystack Onions. Well when I bit into the burger, I had to wonder if Bessie, the cow I was biting into, hadn't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days. Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too. The Einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down. Yeah yeah. The place is still \\\"new.\\\" So this is the moment - like in a game of Hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts, as they say. I'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around. We ain't coming back. Sorry. Smashburger apparently isn't for everyone."}

{"label":3,"text":"My 1st time here. \\n\\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\\n\\nI'll be back for happy hour soon."}
{"label":2,"text":"What kind of BBQ place has no cornbread on the menu? Then we were told they were out of ribs....then told they were out of fries. By the time our food came, we almost forgot what we ordered because of all the substitutions. The pulled pork was good; however, it was barely room temperature. Would have been much better if it was actually hot. Nice atmosphere and our waitress was very friendly. I'd like to go back to try some of their moonshine drinks."}
{"label":2,"text":"I felt the frozen hot chocolate was a little hyped up.  It's just an iced version of hot chocolate.  I thought it was gonna be spectacular too.  By the way, you'd want to order the small since the order for 2 is large enough to feed 4 adults unless you want a sugar high.  My recommendation is a 3\/5.\\n\\nThe entrees sampled are the crispy chicken salad and the crab cake sandwiches.  The crispy chicken salad is your regular old green salad with dressing of your choice.  What's different about it is the large fried chicken pieces that comes with it.  If you want to order a salad just to be conservative on the calories, you might want to eat less of the chicken and more of the greens.  Overall, the crispy chicken salad is 3\/5 but the chicken gives it a +1 so it turns out to be 4\/5.  The crab cake sandwich is just a plain old crab cake sandwich with an inflated price.  That's a 3\/5.\\n\\nOverall, this place is between 3 and 4 stars with more leaning towards 3 stars.  Still, it's a nice place to go for a cold dessert on a hot desert summer day."}
{"label":0,"text":"Never again! I travel a lot. I eat out a lot. I don't Yelp as much as I should... but when I left my dinner here, I knew I had to Yelp this!\\n\\nWe were at BlogWord Expo and had dinner planned with friends and colleagues with a group of 15. We asked if seperate checks were doable (as anyone would with a large group) and she said yes. \\n\\nWe sat down at the table and within minutes the waitress dropped glasses (not one but a few) of water over a friend and the glass shattered all over the floor. My friend was wet. Accidents happen... we get that. But how this was handled was bad. A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. \\n\\nWe brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. \\n\\nThe food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...\\n\\nWe decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!\\n\\nThe bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each! She didn't tell us she would charge double and not double the size for these drinks!\\n\\nThe worst experience I have ever had! $150 for two people and this bad of service! We didn't even get a \\\"I am sorry for the wait and service.\\\"\\n\\nNot once. \\n\\nFor epic... I will Yelp. Epic being good and bad. In this case... epic fail."}

They had close to 10 different types of cold cocktail salads (shrimp, abalone, calamari, octopus, squid etc.) and a few ceviches. They have some seafood based tacos and tostadas as well We went with a small Octopus cocktail ($5.00), a calamari cocktail ($5.00), a crabmeat tostada ($5.00) and the ceviche ((5.00) I have to say everything was awesome awesome awesome. The broth for the cocktails was perfectly seasoned and not too much citrus. You could tell the veggies were recently cut and the fish was super fresh! I think the standout of the whole meal was my crabmeat tostada. It literally had probably 1\/4 of solid good crab meat, with a few avocado slices and a tomato. Insanely simple, let the fish speak for itself. The ceviche was great too. It's a small little restaurant right on the side of the road, but it was very clean and the workers were super nice. I think the total damage was $27 with our food, and a large Horchata. I know I'll be going back. If you're a fan of fresh really simple seafood dishes, this is the spot!"}

It had a little sweet taste to it.  There was the perfect amount of onions and the cheese was perfectly melted on top.  Delicious!  For the main meal my girlfriend and I split the filet mignon with potatoes foresti\\u00e8re and foie gras sauce.  This was awesome.  It is a very heavy dish with steak, potatoes, pearl onions and nice cuts of sliced bacon.

They are very attentive and took care of the clientele that was eating at the restaurant from my observations.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal they even brought out a shot for my lady and I.  It was some schnapps (probably apple).  Thank you for the kind gesture.  \\n\\nAnd by the end of the meal the locals were playing in the fountain that was across from the restaurant.  Someone had thrown some bubbles in and the fountain had turned into a bubble extravaganza.

Allow me to illustrate....\\n\\n1.  Trio of Duck Fat Fries - These were mutha beepin' good!  Loved the bbq flavor fries.  Loved the garlic flavor fries, and most of all, I mutho beepin' loved the truffle fries.  These blows Envy Steakhouse's out of the water (not that ENVY had a chance with their truffle fries anyway).  Let me just call these my Crack Fries.\\n2.  Sashimi (albacore, bigeye, blue fin toro) - The worst decision ever.  We were greedy and thought that \\\"Hey, we're at an expensive restaurant.  It has to be good right?\\\"  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.\\n2.  Bibb Wedge (Salad) - Standard blue cheese, iceberg and bacon.  Yum.\\n3.  American Kobe Ribeye - Good but not juicy.  (Del Frisco's and N9NE still win)\\n4.  Slow Poached Prime Rib - Not juicy, not super tender.  *tear\\n5.  Truffled Macaroni and Cheese!  - Another mutha beepin' good one.  Trufffleeee.... *pump fist.\\n\\nConclusion:  I beepin' loved the fries and mac n cheese.  I will dream of them.  However, the steaks, I will not have, again.  I say save yourself the disappointment, don't go to stripsteak and make it yourself.  I gave them only 3 stars because of the disappointing steaks."}
{"label":2,"text":"Love the idea! We need more places where we can get some healthy eats and drinks!\\nSmoothies and Juices ($7) are great and they have tons of options (squash, beats, ginger, avocado, peppers, gogi, peanut butter, almond milk, coconut water, coco, etc.). You can also make your own. They sweeten most of their drinks with organic raw blue agave. \\nEats ($10) were a little disappointing. This is where the three star rating comes in place. My husband got the Indochin which is a more of a noodle bowl. The flavor was very similar to curry, but doesn't say that on the description, so if you don't like curry don't get this. I got the Gulf of Mexico which was a salad. The shrimp is raw not grilled and the avocado cream is more like mashed avocado. Coming in, I expect it to be healthy; however, being healthy doesn't mean lacking in flavor. I wanted to grab some salt and pour it all over my healthy salad! Not good.

You need to watch out for this and need to sober up!\\n\\nOne of the servers told me that the tip amount for the group gathering (6 people or more) is 18% out of the total before Tax, but when I received the bill the gratuity was 23% AFTER THE TAX amount. (I realized this when I saw the bill next day). So I over paid the tip although I thought the service was OK.

Check out AJ's, Wildflower, Sprinkles, Tammy Coe, etc. and you'll see the same (if not higher).

{"label":3,"text":"Well hello sailor.\\n\\nWhen I had a 1940s event to attend (maybe a Yelp Elite Event that I was hosting...)  I realised I had nothing to wear to the ball! I had visited Lady Jojo's a few times, and never been able to justify buying a beautiful frock, with no occasion that called for a stunning piece of tailoring.\\n\\nAnd so when the question arose of where I could get the perfect dress for my final hurrah and my last Elite Event as the CM, I knew where to go. The dresses aren't ever  at bargain prices, and for good reason. I'd wager the average price is around \\u00a370. I spied a beautiful one on the sale rack, luckily in my size... et voila. It fit like a glove. Or a glass slipper. Or the most beautiful dress I've ever worn.\\n\\nAs I was there, I tried on 5 different dresses out of curiosity. Holy mama. Why don't we dress like this any more? I know women used to have to wear dresses only, and it was a big revelation when we could wear trousers without being considered weird. And I do like trousers, they are practical. But every single one of these dresses fit like a dream, and flattered me in all the right places. More so than any 'vintage inspired' dress from high street shop.\\n\\nThe tailoring is of the highest standard. You know that whoever designed, sewed and fitted this dress was doing it with the sole purpose of making which ever femme fatale wear that dress, that they would look fabulous and nothing less.\\n\\nIt does sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet. But given the amount of compliments I got on the dress and my outfit on the night, I can assure you that it was certainly the beautifully made and fitting dress that stole the show. No high street brand dress would ever make me look or feel that fabulous.\\n\\nThe dress could be worn again, admittedly not just for a laid back Friday date night dinner. But it's low key enough that it will do for birthday parties, new years eve parties... if only I could get away with wearing it to the cinema, brunch, my grocery shopping...\\n\\nI love the dress, I love the shop, I wish I had more reasons and moolah to shop here. A very special \\\"treat\\\" shop, for that once a year special occasion. But if you are feeling like you're having a bad hair day, go to Lady Jojo's and try on one or five of these dresses. You will look fabulous, and will brighten your day no end."}
{"label":0,"text":"Not A Good Value.\\n\\nWow, I 'm a bitch. I just realized that I gave Lin's Grand Buffet four stars.\\n\\nOver the years we have become rather stringent in our reviews. There is no sense in being conciliatory when there are so many other restaurants to patronize. Our dollars go only so far. So if you are a reader who will eat just about anything you may like this place a lot. It starts out very promising. It is neat and clean inside and quite romantic, and the people are friendly. Great date night for intimacy --just not for foodies. If you have a trained palate you will get more out of this review. If you like anything, then you will probably not get much out of this review. We love all food--even truck food. We don't discriminate, but we give fair reviews and credit only where credit is due.\\n\\nStarted with the breadbasket. There were 2 of us, so only 2 rolls brought. They were small and stale. We also had the pepperdews stuffed with goat cheese (six per order at $6 a plate), and the bruschetta (we chose an order with half tomatoes and half crab meat. There were two of each.)\\n\\nThe goat cheese appetizer was cold- not at room temperature- therefore the sweetness of the pepperdews was a bit cloying, but redeemed with the pepper flavored olive oil. A dollar a bite! Kinda leaves a bad taste.\\n\\nIn our opinion the pepperdews should have been packed in extra virgin olive oil and stored at room temperature--and the cheese filling taken out of the fridge an hour before opening the restaurant. The entire appetizer should be room temperature--if they had been we could have eaten another plate of them. The idea of them is appetizing, but the presentation abysmal. Side note: The bit of green  on top was wilted to the point of browning and would make Chef Ramsey cry. Flair is not as important in our book. But, just saying...\\n\\nThe bruschetta, for the money, was a huge disappointment. While there was a sufficient amount of crab on each slice of toast, the bread was not fresh, it was not piping hot, and the crab was absolutely frigid. Crab should have been warmed up first, then served over PIPING HOT, TOASTY bread--which it was not. The crab was (obviously fake) another kind of flaky white fish. Barely passable. The garlic was abundant and good. The tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes. We would take imported canned San Marzanos al fiorno over fresh cherry tomatoes any day of the week. Just a disappointment.\\n\\nMy Sicilian husband pronounced the bruschetta as an  Italian would (broo-SKETT-ah). The waitress passive-agressively shamed him, by repeating it twice as most Americans say it (broo-SHETTA), which only showed her ignorance. Otherwise, she was extremely friendly and talkative and the service was consistently good throughout our meal. I am being very fair here. She was truly nice, but she was sort of clueless.\\n\\nOur California Chardonnay was $29 for the bottle and our server described it as oak barrel aged. It had zero oak--so we think our server possibly made a bit of a mix up there. Anyway, it was just \\\"okay\\\". I expect a lot more for the money, but even then, we still consider $29 for a bottle a low price\/every day price and yet it should have been better, but then wine is totally subjective in our humble opinion.\\n\\nWe ordered a margharita pizza because we didn't think they could possibly disappoint us with something as beautiful and simple as tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Oh boy-- it was PRACTICALLY INEDIBLE!\\n\\nThe crust was decent, even a bit blackened on the bottom like we like it. And that's where that ends. The cheese was a fancy shred blend--like something you'd buy at the grocery store. HORRIBLE. Where were our fresh dollops of beautiful mozzarella? The basil was fresh and friseed, They put cherry tomatoes on this pizza! Not good Amano! Not good! The tomatoes were too small...too sweet. Just...wrong. This is not the pizza of our homeland. Barely palatable. The reason for one star.\\n\\nIn our ongoing effort to find something noteworthy we did something that is law in our book--if the menu offers creme brulee we order it, even if we are not hungry. Creme brulee is a godsend. Unfortunately, the creme brulee here is \\\"meh\\\". If you've had truly great creme brulee nothing else will compare. The best we ever had was at Cafe Cherie in Montreal. It was in a low, wide dish with a thick, rich custard and thick, hard sugar top. Amano serves a small light creme brulee with a sugar top as light as an angel's wing. If that's your thing you'll love it. The vanilla bean had a good flavor. It just fell short in our book, and again--it was frigid, like almost everything else we ate there. Amano--you must take things out of the fridge! You'd solve most of your problems if you did. We did not order the olives for fear they would be pulled from a fridge."}

As a result, Ichiza is always packed, especially in the later hours. Sometimes you won't have to wait or may have a short 5-10 minute wait if you're eating alone or in a party of two (that way you can sit at the bar) but if you require a table, the wait is usually at least 30 minutes or even more. Of course, their earlier hours are less crowded, but many of the menu items (such as skewers) are not available.\\n\\nIchiza has been around for years and they remain pretty consistent in terms of food and service. A few times, however, my orders were forgotten or took a ridiculously long time to arrive. It can get very busy with only a few waitresses so I can see why mistakes happen.\\n\\nThe vibe is very authentic and is a local hotspot. There are item names posted all over the walls in both Japanese and English and sometimes you just have to wing it and see what arrives at your table. My favorites are the beef tataki, skewers (chicken gizzard and liver), grilled squid, and the tuna and tofu salad. The beef bowl is also a nice and filling item if you're hungrier. There is always hot green tea, which I love, and sometimes a little mini appetizer depending on the day and what they have.\\n\\nThere are so many menu items to be had so you really just have to try it yourself. It's a fun and casual dining experience with guaranteed good food that has created so many regulars over the years, myself included."}

{"label":3,"text":"Considering this is a \\\"high-end\\\" thai restaurant, and I actually enjoyed the food, this place deserved 4 stars. Why did I take 1 star off? Because it tasted like a hole in the wall [to yelper's standards] 5 star restaurant back home at L.A.'s thai town, just fancied up a little. The food was excellent, though, but for the prices were a bit high. Why still the 4 star rating? We came here on New year's eve night. Many of the nicer restaurants had prix fixe menus from $75 up and it was hard to find a nice place without one. I for one am not a fan of prix fixe menus. So we made a reservation here for 8:00 and didn't get seated until 8:30. That was annoying because we even split up our party of 14 just so we can get seated quicker. That clearly didn't work. They have to work on that if you ask me.\\n\\nThe restaurant is dark, and very, very busy. They also don't have a restroom so you'd have to go to the casino floor to use one. It's nicely decorated, but I've eaten at Tao at the Venetian, which is much nicer, and similar in pricing. They also give you chopsticks... uh, they don't use chopsticks in thailand, they use a spoon and a fork. You'd think a restaurant full of Thai workers would know better.\\n\\nWe ordered the phad thai, pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and bbq pork chop entree. The 4 of us split it and it was all very good. Like I said, it tasted like it does at a popular authentic thai restaurant in l.a., but for twice as much. The service was slow at times, but it was new year's eve and it was a packed house. We always had plenty of water, and the waitress was good about checking on us, but she wasn't spectacular. She did bring my sister's request of chili paste and chili powder really quickly, which was nice.\\n\\nI wouldn't come back here because I'm sure there's a thai restaurant somewhere off the beaten path in vegas which can make food just as good, and for lower prices.

The veggie burger has walnuts which makes it hard for someone with nut allergies.  The House Special Tomato soup has bacon cooked in it and the couscous has pistachios on it.  Making it through the meal, we ordered dessert. We were again disappointed.  The Silky Chocolate Souffle' Cakes was neither silky nor souffle'.  It was more like a dense brownie cake.  The French White Chocolate Bread Pudding was burned on the bottom and I suppose the Fresh Apple Pie was good, my son at it all, but I couldn't taste it because it too had nuts in it.

It certainly helped that we were handed free entry coupons as we left the cab --- 'no cover' are two of the best words to hear together at a club.  \\n\\nThe music was more trippy\/trancy than anything else, but that was perfect for the time of night.  The sparse crowd (we were there early for an after-hours club --- 2am) ran heavily to wannabe Euro-gigolos in big bug-eyed sunglasses but started to fill later with a cross section of late-night dwellers.

They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it. Even when the place is almost empty, it takes FOREVER to get your sushi. \\n\\nWe've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs, meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants, especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe. When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home, at the time the service was excellent and fast, and the quality and quantity was worth the price. Forget that! You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. \\n\\nWe ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!! Holy crap, sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER, yes I said AFTER, we did but not our 2 measly rolls. \\n\\nWe also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink. Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself. Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well. \\n\\nI finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave. When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something. She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible. She said OK thank you, so we walked out. \\n\\nHey, wait a minute, I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress. \\n\\nYou know, we love, and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills, no pun intended"}

It was the worst value considering the service- at $445 a night for a simple, basic room, when our economy is in a recession and hotel trends are weakening, I expect friendly and prompt service AT A MINIMUM.  I found the conceirge to be confused, give us poor directions (i.e. taking 30 mins to get somewhere that took 5 minutes), recommended a terrible restaurant to us (Los Olivos) that was completely unsuitable, and never letting us know our folio of reservations and most importantly, NOT LETTING US KNOW WHEN she had been unable to make reservations that she suggested.  \\n\\nThe construction at the deck right above the pool was also an issue - no one had notified us of.  The jackjammering started at 915 AM on Friday.  The manager did give us a $100\/night rate abatement after I had to complain - which I appreciated but would have preferred to not have the conversation in the first place.  \\n\\nThe room was also dirty - our feet kept turning black and we couldnt figure out why - and we were utterly disgusted to realize it was from our HOTEL ROOM.

I called ahead  & scheduled a 5pm appt, on a Thursday. I showed up 20min early (my errands didn't take as long as I was expecting) so didn't mind waiting. \\n\\nIt was now 5:03p & I was still waiting (5 appt, not a big deal). But then, a regular came in after me (they greeted each other by name). She sat by me for a few minutes, then was taken to start her mani before me! Finally at 5:15p, the lady (seemed like the owner) took me to a seat to start the process to remove my gel polish. I'm not big on talking while getting my nails done, but she didn't say 1 word to me. And she made feel like I was an inconvenience to her (even if I was, I'm paying you money to run your business). So after putting the tinfoil on, she said I'll wait 5minutes, that's standard. \\n\\nFinally, around 5:32 (15 min later) another girl, Jessica greeted me, apologized for the wait, & began. She gave me a small water bottle, cleaned her tools in barbacide, thanked me for waiting & did my mani. Jessica was sweet & the highlight of my trip.  Although, I am not satisfied with my French tip mani I received... We met at the register & I handed her her the coupon. Because I received French tip I assumed they would honor the \\\"gel mani coupon\\\" but add an additional fee. Jessica spoke to the lady I assumed is an owner (the 1 who started to remove my gel). Jessica then told me they cannot accept the coupon & had to pay full price. Did I mention no where on that coupon does it list any restrictions?\\n\\nThe time was now 6:40p, 2 hours after I arrived, 1 h 40m after my appt time, I just wanted to go home so didn't argue. So, NO, I will never go back. It's a cute, small, clean place. But not only did I have a horrible 1st impression, it wasn't a good job. The polish didn't cover my full nail (looks as if some of my nails already 'grew out'), the white isn't even (looks like some areas are missing a coat), & there's a white cloudiness in some areas of my nails that are supposed to be the 'natural' color. \\n\\nI'm glad majority of people love this place.

It is kind of hit and miss with the slices when you go in. I am guessing because they are usually sitting there and you have to reheat them etc. When we order delivery the pies are great, hot, cheesy with fresh toppings. So I would say if you are in their range for delivery then by all means do so or pick up a pie. They can keep the slices. The salads are OK. I think they should invest in better dressing. They use the  cheap store brought stuff and you can definitely tell. J and J upgrade to better dressing. \\n\\nThe place seems to be run my a bunch of teenagers. I never see anyone in there older than 22 or so. But I have to say they are always attentive, cheerful and get your food out to you ASAP.

I was seeking this place out every since I read an ROTD on it from last November.  Never found the time and wasn't in the area to ever try them until now. \\n\\nLet's start with the restaurant itself.  It's bigger than I expected. One thing missing from most reviews is the size of this restaurant. I expected a small typical pizza joint with your checkered red\/white tablecloths and gaudy decorations all over. Boy was I totally moted!!  This restaurant is classy, spacious, clean, and well lit.  Because of what I experienced walking in, I assumed a pricey menu.  My first thoughts, sure glad Terri R. is paying for lunch this time. Then I reviewed the menu and was brought back down to earth.  Bang for your buck for sure! \\n\\nMetro Pizza has a large selection of pizza, stuffed pizza, salads, calzones, platters, dinners, and one type of soup (Minestrone).  I didn't want to feel too heavy for lunch, so I opted against pizza this time.  I'm not a huge pizza guy anymore anyways.  I chose their Chicken Parmesan Sub w\/Garlic Fries ($9.25).  This is served hot, melted cheese, and just the right amount of sauce on top of about 8 oz of breaded chicken breast.  Simply delicious, portions big, and the chicken breast tender.  I washed my parmesan sub down with their garlic fries and glass of water.  In about 10 minutes, my meal was devoured.  \\n\\nOne thing about Italian Restaurants, either there's too much sauce which sometimes sogs out your meal or there's not enough where you're wanting more.  At Metro, they had it just right, not too much, not too little, and definitely not too thick.  Since I'm a new fan of Metro's Parm Sub, I'm sure their pizzas are good too.  Service was great from start to finish. Our food was also prepared and served with little wait. \\n\\nVoted \\\"The Best of Las Vegas\\\" 7 years in a row!!!

Since I thought it'd be convenient to stay at MGM, I also booked a room - king size, non smoking. The prices for two nights were $149 (Friday night), $179 for Saturday night. They charged me $166. When I got there, I was told the room wasn't available. If I wanted, I got \\\"the option\\\" to upgrade (which I'd have to pay for). I got slightly upset, although I never raised my voice. \\n\\nI asked why I'm being charged $166 for something I'm not getting and why I was forced to pay for something I don't want? The manager came over and immediately said \\\"She's just doing her job!\\\" No s**t Sherlock! I'm not upset at the receptionist, I'm upset at the situation. Not fair to be charging customer for something he\/she's not getting.

This is great for someone who eats at buffets and drinks, but I'm not a drinker and I don't eat at buffets, but when I said it to the manager, she said \\\"well, that's your only option.\\\" In regards to rooms, they are spacious, clean.

You are already placing $500 charge on my CC, I guess I'm expecting you to say what you are going to give back to me. \\n\\nAnyway, long story short, the 2 nights cost me total $502. They charge you for upgrade you didn't want, they also charge your for something called \\\"remodeled room\\\", \\\"remodeled room tax\\\" (these charges are for every day you are staying) on top of your regular resort fee. I'm assuming that is normal, but quite frankly....for $250\/night - it is NOT worth it."}

The Kobe burger I thought was a bit disappointing, and maybe the extra $12 would have made it better - but I thought the flavor fell flat.  The Button Burger, which also has short ribs and onion rings was very, very tasty.  It was a shame I had to share half of it with my wife.\\n\\nAnd there is a nice selection of microbrews to choose from.\\n\\nSo I was hoping for a nice night of a big, juicy burger, and drinking some beers -- but essentially, we got a fast-food type of waiter -- who was taking food off of our table, even though we were still grazing on the chips and fries -- and dropping off the check without asking if there was anything else, which in fact, would have been another round of beers.  \\n\\nI'm sure if I had a better experience, one which lasted longer than a Kardashian marriage, I'm sure I would come back.  And if you haven't been here, I still think it's worth trying.

I always felt like the massage was much shorter so on my last visit I decided to time it w\/ the stop watch on my iPhone.  It was half as long as it should have been but they charge you for it.  Make sure you are getting what you are paying for if you go for an upgraded pedicure.\\n\\nReckless: Very aggressive w\/ the metal cheese grater looking tool they use on everyone's feet.  There is a more gentle way of getting the dead skin off of your feet ladies.  This rough and aggressive approach is very dangerous.  \\n\\nCuticles: They cut the cuticles way to close to the skin which isn't necessary.  Your cuticles are there for a reason. Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection.  You should just get your cuticles pushed back but not cut off.\\n\\nSanitation: They bring the tools out in what looks like a \\\"sterile bag\\\" that a hospital would keep scalpels in.  They open the bag in front of you which is a false sense on security because my guy placed the instruments back into the bag and pinched the end closed when he was done w\/ my pedicure.  I don't know what he did with the tools after that? Did he bring the same tools out of that bag for the next person without sanitizing them properly? Were they clean when he peeled the bag open for me?

I soaked my fingers in the bowl which had glass stones in the bottom.  She cut my natural nails so SHORT! I wanted to keep the length and just wanted them evened up...to late for that since she clipped the first two so short  without asking how I wanted them.  When she finished the manicure she went to the sink, put her hands on the stones to keep them in the bowl, and then dumped the water down the drain.  Then she put the bowl w\/ stones back under the sink.  I am suspecting they don't sanitize the bowl or stones between manicures and just store it under the sink.  The thought of someone else's cuticles and nail clippings in the stones is disgusting! \\n\\nThey are very pushy with the upgrades for gel nails, nail art, waxing, deluxe pedicures etc...

I found the perfect shade of navy blue curtains here I couldn't find anywhere else.  Exactly what I envisioned so it was hard changing my mind about anything, but they were hundreds of dollars for curtains.  Perhaps that's the standard, I wouldn't know because everywhere I've lived always came with blinds and I recently bought my first home that was set up for curtains.

Considering the hefty cost she turned them away which was smart to do.\\n\\nAnother reason I just gave them 3 stars and not more is I've been here about 2 times on my own, 6 times with friends and not once has a store worker ever approached us to ask us if we needed help with anything.  In fact, I'm honestly not sure what the workers look like because I really can't remember seeing anyone there.  Do they wear street clothes, business attire, uniforms? I really don't know.

There was only one other person who ordered a drink before me (in the store)"}
{"label":0,"text":"I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege."}

A small cinnamon roll French toast, and a small combo plate with 1 egg, 1 sausage link, 1 biscut, and hash browns. It was so good that I ate everything except half the biscuit. And that was because I was simply out of room by them.\\n\\nThe only slightly problemic thing was that my BF ordered a large orange juice and what he got was more like a small or regular. And he had to ask the waiter for it twice. Yes, the juice was fresh-squeezed, but for $3+ we expected more."}

Expect waits if you want to save extra bucks.  The place is really nice, great ambience and the food is very good.  I recommend if you want to take advantage of the special that you come on Mondays, for some reason Tuesdays are busier... One big annoyance is the valet parking, they enforce it here but it is free. If you can ride your cruiser here, do it they have several posts."}

{"label":0,"text":"How many people will get fooled coming here thinking it's great Asian food? The duck was OK. It's just not worth it.  Took 2 hours to get our regular order. Other tables got up and left. Our party of 10 stayed and roughed it out. When the food finally came it was cold and we were too tired to enjoy it. So they write a few Chinese words on the ceiling and throw in some asian looking statues. Ok looks like a Chinese restaurant now. Lol. To sum it up the food sucked and the service sucker. We went to the club and it was packed. They didn't count how many just let everyone in. I think the fire Marshalls came. Am I a complainer? No! This whole facility is poorly managed. Who is the GM and where were they 1.1.2015? Fire them asap. BTW. Who serves duck with Tortillas?? Its supposed to be with Steam buns. You don't see Asians in here which means it's an expensive version of PF Changs at most. You don't see Asians at Panda Express either.  Hint hint  I dont mind spending $1000.00 for food but it better be a decent experience.  So now they can take some of that money to put into marketing and lure in more suckers. Save your money and TIME because this place will take them both from you."}

The prices definitely reflect that you're paying for the location and not necessarily the quality of the food.  \\nMy boyfriend had the seafood Udon which he liked.

{"label":1,"text":"I came here for a late lunch\/early dinner. There was one party of people in front of me and most of the restaurant was empty but there was still about a 10 minute wait. The d\\u00e9cor is somewhat sad when you think of a place that is in a hotel like Aria. The d\\u00e9cor looked old and faded with scuff marks all round. While the view was pretty I was seated at a table that had the sun shining directly in my face and there are no window shades. \\n\\nWe ordered the Fish & Chips and the Jambalaya Pasta. I have to say that the Fish & Chips was kind of a mess with the batter being kind of soggy and the fries just kinda bland. It wasn't worth the $22 bucks that it costs except for that it was a rather large portion. The Jambalaya pasta was another large portion and was decent but again nothing overly wonderful. The chicken in it was a bit dry and it was swimming in sauce. That dish was also $22 bucks but again wasn't really worth the money.  \\n\\nWe finished eating and didn't even want to bother taking our left overs. So we paid and got out as quickly as possible. I usually think that hotel coffee shops are pretty much the same with sub-par food and this one was the same. Which I think is a shame since there are so many other higher quality eateries in the Aria to choose from. You're better off grabbing some coffee and a pastry from Jean Philippe Patisserie."}

You would think it would be all fancy shmancy but as soon as we walked in and saw some people chilling there in their t shirts in jeans, realized it was pretty casual.  But we didn't feel awkward being all dressed up.\\n\\nI thought the concept of the menu was cool.  Basically you choose from a selection of Japan\/Korea, Indian, Singapore\/Hong Kong and Thai cuisine.  The plates are tapas style and meant for sharing so they recommend 3 to 4 per person.  \\n\\nOr you may choose from two \\\"Bento Delight\\\" selections for 48 bucks, which is basically their prix fix combos.\\n\\nWe didn't go with the Bento and ordered the garlic and cheese naan, mustard chicken tikka, yum ma muang, char siew pork & siew yoke, sashimi and we were both pretty stuffed.  Dishes were good except the char siew pork and siew yoke, didn't care for that one.  The sashimi was excellent.\\n\\nOverall, it was good but nothing wow especially for the price, 10-12 bucks per plate.  Kinda silly to pay 12 bucks for naan but at least it was good and hey it's vegas.  So if you are in the area and looking for something different to try, Mozen is A-Ok!"}

Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.

I wouldn't come here just for the food though. The only shining light to this experience is that they served us foie gras when it's not available for lunch. But it is available for dinner, so why not just make it available at all times instead of making people ask for it?"}
{"label":2,"text":"My never-ending quest for amazing breakfasts led me to Liberty Market yesterday. This place is cool and shiny in a stainless steel, bedazzled, old farmhouse sort of way. The atmosphere is definitely the main thing the place has going for it-- always packed, always lively, new and hip. I also give it props for using obviously fresh, local produce and meat. \\n\\nThat being said, the breakfast didn't blow me away. I got a traditional combo of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and a blueberry pancake. My date ordered the veggie scramble with a buttermilk biscuit and homefries. The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking. If I ever find myself in the boonies again, I would hit this place up (if only because there's not a whole lot of other options.)"}

The cover charge for guys on Saturday nights is currently $50 and $20 for girls, no discounts either, not even for locals. I guess this is what happens when you have the most happening spot in Vegas. The line for this place is legendary so I suggest getting there are 9pm when they open the doors, I know that sounds crazy but unless you enjoy waiting in a lines I would get there early or get bottle service.  FYI, if you get there after 10pm it will be the longest line you have ever waited in your whole life.\\n\\nBut how can I give this place 5 stars, because simply it is by far the best, most amazing club I have been too. With great music and an even better crowd! Honestly if you are in Vegas you have to go here, you will feel like you have walked into a movie. They also have this pool that you cannot go into on Friday and Saturday nights, only ankle deep is allowed. There are no signs about this though so it was funny watching random people get thrown or jump in then escorted out. Actually this whole table decided to foolishly jump into the pool, got kicked out, and my friends and I got to hijack their whole table after they got bounced... shhh don't tell anyone."}
{"label":0,"text":"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a\/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."}

The thing about this airport is it's freaking tiny...I mean it's huge but really the ceilings are soooo low and there's hardly any seating so most people are sprawled along the hallways. There are slot machines around every corner which you think might be kind of fun until you realize they're shitty machines and most people sitting at them are asleep because there is no where else to sit! In fact most people in the place were either hung over, drunk or asleep. Again to be expected in Vegas.

It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  \\n\\nWell......that is not exactly the way it turned out. \\n\\nI've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  \\n\\nEach time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  \\n\\nI'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management\/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  \\n\\nOnce we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  \\n\\nBy this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR. \\n\\nI've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers."}

It does seem like a fitting place, but it kind of pissed me off when I went in there last night. Every single TV at the bar was tuned to March Madness and all I wanted to do was watch the Pens game. I kindly asked the bar keep if he could switch a TV for me to the Pens game and he said its on that TV over there. So one TV in the corner of the restaurant had the game on it and you couldn't even of sat at the bar to see what was happening on it. I could have understood more if the place was jam packed with people wanting to watch the March Madness games, but on a Thursday night at 9pm and only 3 people at the bar and a few TV's even showing the same game, I shoot the bar keep a look like really bud? But lo and behold the Pens game was still not put on so I had to squint with my eyes across the whole restaurant to watch. I thought about leaving and going next door to the Beermarket cause it was just one of those days and the majority of their TVs in there had the Pens game on when I walked by, but who wants to pay 6-8$ for a cold one...\\n\\nThat being said, they did have a cheep Miller Light 2$ ponder on special for March Madness so after a few of those my mood lightened up a bit. I also ordered a plethora of food throughout the evening. I started off with some wings, ehhh I'll pass next time. Pretty generic wing and hot sauce all around there. Plus for $11 I'd like to get more than ten pieces...Next up was the Truffle Fries. They were sprinkled with truffle oil, parsley, Parmesan cheese and some kind of lemon butter spread. Honestly I scarfed these down pretty quickly. They were delicious! Finally I settled on the Beef Sliders which were equally as good as the fries. \\n\\nBesides being a little pouty about the Pens game not being able to be put on, I'll continue to come back here again since its within walking distance of my place and try some of the other sandwiches, burgers, and apps on the menus. Being a hot wing kind of guy, I think I'll pass on their wings though as they seemed pretty generic, but they do have a nice liquor and cocktail bar menu with a ton of drafts on hand if that's more your thing too. \\nI'm sure this is a cool place to come and pregame for before a Steelers or Pirates game as well.\\nI'd give this place a 3.5 if I could...Its not bad, its not great...but it could be better.\\n\\nMay your drink always stay cold!\\nYours truly, the Shaw...."}

I picked up some of their tacos right before they packed it up for the night during a minor brewery crawl.  I brought a decent sized group, so we got to try the staple tacos. \\n\\nFirst of all, the average order is between $7-$9's for three tacos and that is a lot of food! \\nThe food came out relatively quick, around 10 minutes and all four orders were out right after the other.  We had the Korean Bulgogi Steak Tacos that definitely brought some heat with the red peppers and tang via the marinade.  The Teriyaki Chicken Taco's were flavorful, but the safe option to choose.  Lastly, we split the Thai coconut Chicken Taco's and they were exceptional!  Overall the tacos were seasoned well and juicy, but had more vegetables as filler at the forefront than meat.      \\n\\nThe guys running the truck were nice and efficient and I would definitely go back if I ever crossed paths with 'em in NoDa again."}
{"label":1,"text":"Ok, since it's an Asian restaurant, bad service and long waits are acceptable as long as the food is good. \\n\\nFor the last 2 months, the pho has been great. It was the best pho restaurant that I have found in Phoenix and I have been recommending this place non-stop. I don't know what is going on today, maybe the chef is sick or something, but the pho was terrible. It was just lazily prepared. The beef slices were thick instead of thin like it was the last 10 times I've been there. My bowl felt like a bunch pho ingredient was thrown in and topped off with beef stock. Nothing worked together, there were no flavor. There was nothing I could do to make it taste well. I will stop recommending this restaurant for now but will give it another try later on. If this is how this place is going to be from now on, I will no longer come. If it improves, I will definitely update the review to 4 stars like it deserves. Minus one star for service and wait for food."}

They'll smirk at you when you refuse the table\/cabana service outside...then laugh when you come back to them asking for one after checking out the scene. They have tables with minimum $200 drink\/food purchase..but you'll end up paying more because of service and table fees. pssh!

Several minutes later after I had received my thimble size glass of wine for $9.50, another couple came in who had no reservations--yet were seated at a table in the relatively open restaurant.  I removed 2 stars just for the ineffective table management (yes, I know it's always best to have a reservation)\\n\\nPizza -   was delivered fairly promptly with tasty sauce. There is nothing like a true Wood-fire oven for Pizza, and Magpie has one.   I chose the margarita pizza with added anchovies and a handful of rocket greens on top.  the pizza was good but the crust was not quite as good as what I found at Bottega - in little Italy.  The hipster setting of Mile End is what it is and the staff were nice. For me still, the best real- Italian pizza experience is at  Bottega. I find them to be the winner.  Value for Money was not there with Magpie.  Wine \/ cocktails were way over priced for what you get, however the mixed cocktails were well put together."}

However, that's not to say that this isn't a gem to be enjoyed.\\n\\nOld Town Scottsdale on a Sunday afternoon (as I experienced it on vacation last week) is quiet and hot.  There wasn't too much to do and the kids were getting restless.  That being said, it was only 1pm and it was lunch time.  The bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road (Scottsdale Rd) in Old Town Scottsdale.  Besides, any place that's been around for 50+ years has merit with me.  \\n\\nOne piece of advice I'd offer is keep it simple.  A burger is an ok order, but stay away from the Reuben.  Should be simple, but somehow...outside of NY... I rarely get one that's worthy of the name.  And this was no exception.  \\n\\nBIG GRIPE:  No Fries???  They serve potato chips with all their sandwiches, no fries.  Don't get me wrong I like their \\\"Kettle Chips\\\" (which aren't made there, but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back).  But a true old time parlor should have french fries.  Ok, end of gripe.\\n\\nNow to the ice cream.  I won't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly I didn't have much.  I had a coffee shake which was quite good actually.  My mother-in-law got the '23 Skiddoo\\\" that I was eyeing and she was quite happy with it...  It was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream, with coffee syrup, sliced almonds, whipped cream & a cherry.  It looked great and got a thumbs up from mom.

Just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they're happy.\\n\\nOverall it was a good stop and had fantastic, friendly service. \\n\\nThe attached arcade left alot to be desired, but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor."}

We ended up ordering the tiramisu for dessert even though my aunt was hesitant because the example looked really creamy. It was really creamy, but surprised us in how delicious it was!

Ain't it grand?\\n\\nThe booths are comfy, the interior is chill and low-light, service varies from great to distracted, and the menu is huge (including a large-ish Veg selection, plus their open-mindedness about subs and alterations). But being as huge a fan of the mexican flavor set as I am, it hurts my soul to see it bandied about, willy-nilly. At least they aren't claiming to be \\\"authentic\\\", as some other high-end places in this town declare - Mexican inspired is pretty accurate.\\n\\nSo I get my order of veggie enchiladas with tomatillo salsa and, although its interesting, there's so much happening in my mouth that with every bite, I'm scratching my head a little harder. To start, they use the same veg mix in all their vegetarian dishes - a finely shredded mix of shrooms, zuch, sweet plantains, pepper. Corn, even. Things are cooked down to an unrecognizable pile of whatever. Too sweet. Pair that with a very carefully opposite of hot green sauce and super mild queso fresco, and you've got the idea - there's no bright, interesting ooomph to tie the dish together, and it needs it, badly.\\n\\nOther stuff I've had makes me think I'm eating a Big Mac (yeah, its been a while, but still)- the plantain side \\\"salad\\\" is too much, too sweet, 15 flavors all at once that collide and become gastronomic mush. There's sugar, or sweetening agents, in so many things here. Rice, even. Sheesh.\\n\\nThey did make me a torta con huevos y queso, no arguments, although it wasn't on the menu. It was tasty and messy - reminded me of Chicago style rather than NY. \\n\\nThe salsa is bland, but the chips are perfect. They have a jalapeno margarita (6$) that is probably the spiciest thing on the menu (but isn't, really)."}
{"label":4,"text":"Holy guacamole this place is good!  Why have I not been here before?  Why do I continue to frequent mediocre establishments that are more convenient?  Deciding to try something new and actually use one of my usually worthless Groupons before it expired, we made the long and difficult 6-mile trek to SMG.\\n\\nI was soon greeted with chips, two full of flavor, but not too hot salsas, and a bowl of that delightful guacamole.  Granted the chips were not my favored thin, crispy, and lightly greasy chip, but they sufficed for scooping salsa and scraping the last bit of guac from the sides of the bowl...restaurants tend to frown when you lick a bowl, which is why places like SMG offer take-out thankfully.\\n\\nSoon to arrive at my table would be the carne asada taco plate.  Two of the most delicious tacos I have ever had.  It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about those wonderfully seasoned morsels of beef surrounded by the best corn tortillas this side of wherever has the best corn tortillas.  Beans and rice are not just empty fillers here either.  The charro beans are worthy of a meal on their own.  I should also note I was somewhat envious of my husband's carne asada burrito which was toasted.  Living my childhood 30 miles from the Mexican border, I foolishly assumed everyone toasted their burritos (only we called them burros).  I grew up quickly when I realized the harsh reality was that this wasn't true in most parts of the world.  It's a sad reality, indeed.  Luckily, SMG knows how things should be.\\n\\nWe had wonderful service from the owner who reminded us that everything is made fresh.  As if you wouldn't know after one bite."}
{"label":0,"text":"I'm torn...what to say about Shitbay..well guess I'm not too torn..okay my wife and I went here 6 month back and the need to review my experience has been haunting me since then. I'll make this short and sweet..The food was wonderful but..big but..my wife is not a sushi eater, she went with me for me..we ordered the large course dinner..at one point, we received some sushi and my wife asked the waitress for some soy and wasabi..now granted this is a gourmet restaurant...but still when one is paying hundreds of dollars for food they should get what they want?? So the server,bless her heart, went to ask the chef( and looked worried I might add) for these items..we were sitting at the bar..The chef looks at her and said \\\"no way\\\"..then looks at my wife and yells \\\"NO WAY!\\\" Then turns away..glad there were no samurai swords on the wall!!! My wife started crying (more from embarrassment). .I immediately got up had a word with the manager and he replied \\\"sorry that's just the way he is!\\\" Worst dining experience of my life!"}

{"label":0,"text":"LET'S BE TRUTHFUL... \\n\\nLast week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in. \\n\\nAs we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said... \\n\\n\\\"Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?\\\" \\n\\nI thought to myself and replied, \\\"Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register. \\n\\nNotwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner. \\n\\n\\nPERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TI\\n\\nI was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel\/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?\\n\\nIf you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then..."}

Our server's name was Angela who was very pleasant. She took our drink orders and disappeared, the sodas came out quickly but the bar stuff took several extra minutes, the the server disappeared. She came back and took our appetizer order and then disappeared ( you are starting to get the idea) it took 90 minutes for most of us to get our dinner, we were actually afraid to ask for refills or anything else for fear we would never see our server again! \\n\\nThe manager on duty came over and was very pleasant and apologized and promised to investigate the speed of service, when she came back she offered us 25% off our bill. \\n\\nServer brought us our checks (yes we split the bill) and no discount! And she disappeared, she came back and we explained the there was no discount on the bills, she gathered them up and disappeared and then she's back and announced that it was fixed! We examined the bill and on my check it said \\\"10 card 25%\\\" but the discount off the food before tax was NINE percent. \\nWe gave up BWW had won, we paid, tipped a small amount and headed for the door we stopped by the manager and asked for a quick math lesson who explained that the friends and family discount we got didn't cover what we bought. I thought we were getting 25%? \\n\\nSo bottom line service was S L O W, food was very good! Manager not so much.  Everyone was very pleasant. I am going to pass on this place next time."}
{"label":0,"text":"Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste."}
{"label":0,"text":"We arrived to pick up our vehicle having a reservation.  Despite the line not being particularly long they took forever.  Everything they tried to sell to my husband he declined.  Despite that we turned in the car being charged $337.77 for 3 days for a Camry despite having a quote of $142.08 for a Corolla.  One of our charges was for an upgrade which they say my husband agreed to although he never did.  Another thing they did was charge us for fuel.  They told my husband it was cheaper to have them fill up the vehicle when he returned the car.  That may have been true if the vehicle was returned empty.  They charge you for a full tank of gas despite what you use.  They failed to mention that.  I'm sure it was it the small print somewhere so our mistake but consider it a warning.  They left out the important fact which is deceiving.  We returned a car with 3\/4 of a full tank and were charged $54.72 for fuel.  I will not use Hertz again."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! \\\"Multi-tainment\\\" center perfectly describes this place. You can eat, lounge, bowl, play and watch movies all in the same place! This place houses 3 restaurants (347 Grill, Luxe and Cones Caf\\u00e9) The 347 Grill and the Luxe share the same kitchen, so you'll get the same food quality. The biggest difference between the two is the 347 Grill is family friendly and the Luxe is for adults only with more emphasis on the drinks as the bar anchors this lounge\/restaurant. My group ate at the Luxe due to the wait at Grill 347; the food was okay nothing to scream about good enough to keep the night festive, the price points were dead on. I had the Mediterranean salad which was well balanced and good in size however I wish the cucumbers were more freshly cut.  My husband ordered the Honey BBQ wings which were good in size, well sauced and crunchy, yum! The other people in my party all enjoyed their food as well. After dinner we headed over to the Ultra Star cinemas for a movie. For an additional $2.50 you can upgrade to the \\\"Star Class\\\" area upstairs and view your movie minor free with drink and waiter service, score!!! I didn't get a chance to bowl at the \\\"Tin Pens\\\" bowling alley but next time I definitely will. The Arcade was decent. What I like most about this place is the open concept, there are plenty of areas to lounge all around and all the areas of interest seem to flow harmoniously into one another.

When I got to the counter I was told they didn't even have a car the property and would make some phone calls. They told me they had another car, but they wanted to charge me extra. (I've always been upgraded at no extra cost in these situations) I booked my car through hotwire and was told that by choosing a compact over economy that I would get more features. However, when I got my car it didn't even have cruise and I had to put on about 300 miles. The car didn't drive straight, wasn't that clean (front windshield was streaked from the inside and something was spilled in the center cup holder.) There were no power seats or adjustable steering wheel. (I found a lever, but it didn't seem to do anything - broken maybe?) I was mostly upset that the car didn't have cruise, you would think that would be a standard feature. When I returned the car and the lady asked me how it was, I told her that I was unhappy, but she didn't seem to really have anything to say except when I told her my biggest complaint was that it didn't have cruise, she did say that the guy who issued the car to me at the airport should have told me that.

The soup that comes with lunch is really weird... kind of sweet and kind of spicy.... not the best soup ever, so that knocked off a star, but other than that, I thought the food was very good.

If you're one of those people that gets uncomfortable when nail techs constantly talk to each other in a different language (it doesn't bother me) that doesn't really happen here because not everyone here speaks the same language. \\n\\nOverall this is one of the best\/comfortable nail salons I've been to. The prices are pretty low for the amount of quality you get in my opinion. They sometimes have problems with their credit card machine so bring cash if possible.

The entree's were disappointing and not very appetizing in appearance. Our two friends ordered the carnitas tacos, I had the steak and chicken fajita combo and my wife had a tostada salad. The carnitas were made with cubed meat that resembled dog kibble. The fajitas were tasteless. All three came with dried out rice and crusty beans.

I have played about a dozen different courses in the Scottsdale area and for me this was the nicest I have played."}

I like the car wash fair enough, and there are vacuum cleaners available with car wash purchase. The store is always very busy but the cashiers were efficient and polite. The store seems to be clean enough. Far too often there are panhandlers scamming people, but there isn't much the property can do about it except tell the panhandlers to leave."}
{"label":2,"text":"Ok, it's Harrah's.  And it USED to be the flagship of Harrah's properties in Vegas but now it's kind of middle of the road.  Since Ceasar's is their flagship property, larger and more luxurious but Harrahs' will do in a pinch.\\n\\nI've had a few stays at Total Rewards Properties (Ceasars\/Harrah's) recently.  Although an older property, and probably not the most luxurious of the Caesars Entertainment properties, it's surefire, and smack dab in the middle of the Strip action. Right across street from Ceasars, their Forum Shops, across street from Mirage, next door to the Quad (soon to become the Linq Hotel and Casino and NOT soon enough) and short walk to Flamingo.\\n\\nI stayed in the Carnival Tower by choice because the room was sizeably bigger than the Mardi Gras Tower, but it was an older room.  It will be remodeled eventually I'm told. My friends stayed in the Mardi Gras Tower, which have mini balconies, are non-smoking, and usually have awesome poolside views.  The location of that tower is a little closer to the casino and Strip as well. But I had a minor upgrade to the High Roller view room, I think, and it had an awesome view of the new High Roller attraction (Worlds tallest Ferris wheel temporarily). There are many different types of rooms and suites available in both towers, and the property is pet friendly.  \\n\\nMy room was always kept really clean, and I was pretty surprised at the friendliness of the housekeeping staff.  Minibar unstocked.......left empty.  Could see where a mini fridge had been removed and my shower head had a small leak.  But noise didn't affect me and who wants to pay exhorbitant prices for minibar stuff anyway.  Downstairs they had several shops, well stocked for normal hotel shops, including clothing, to usual gift shop, to fair selection of alcohol. \\n\\nCasino is a little outdated.  An absurd kitsch statute of an older couple right in the middle of the entrance from the hotel to the casino that is comical and looks \\\"comic\\\"like, too.\\n\\nNo problems with any staff members whatsoever, everyone's always been very friendly.  Especially security staff, who were plentiful, and Total Rewards staff, along with check in.  But I'm a little lucky there since I get to use the Platinum\/Diamond check in which is separate from the general check-in lines........thereby avoiding QUITE a wait.  If I had any complaint at all it was at check out when the clerk had a hard time explaining how my points were deducted to pay my room charges.  But we worked it out.  And the cashier personnel were very, very helpful and accommodating.  And they remembered you, too!\\n\\nFairly large casino, a little plain for me, but like I said they are in the process of remodeling the entire property in parts.  New food court coming.  But thought the games were a little stingy.  TOO MANY 6-5 Blackjack tables.........do NOT play 6-5 Blackjack.......that is NOT real blackjack.  But they also had regular 3-2 blackjack with good rules, though the table limits were a little higher.  \\n\\nOther amenities or restaurants include a gourmet burger place, called Kerry's I think, a Toby Keith Love this Bar and Grill, Flavor's Buffet was very good, very good servers, but a little overpriced for a Vegas Buffet..........my price was over $20, which I thought was a little high.  Starbucks abound.  Both floors.  And there is a monorail station on the second floor, too.  Outdoor Carnival Court that was rocking on weekend.  But though this place USED to have a Mardi Gras theme, I think it's lost that feel.\\n\\nNice Piano Lounge near one of the entrances.  Fat (or Big?) Elvis impersonator.  Pic reflected.  Had a great \\\"cover voice\\\" and you should have seen all the older folks dancing to his music and having a good time!\\n\\nFor the price I paid (Total Rewards partially comped) it's a great place, price and location."}

We ordered the braised short ribs and the veal. The short ribs were excellent, came with knocchi on the bottom, very well portions. With the veal, I would skip it.

{"label":1,"text":"Inside Circus Circus\\n\\nFrom being rewarded to their pretty good rating I'm led to believe that we descended upon this restaurant on a really really bad night. I'll explain why in a moment...\\n\\nThe first thing I'll highlight is how reminded you will be that you're in a steakhouse... from all the Cow Decor, to the smell of the cooking beef wafting through the air, to the kitchen being smack dab in the middle of the dining room, to the various cuts of beef being hung on display. Honestly not one bit of this impressed me, but I was still optimistic because of their reputation. The place looks very dated and although it may have been really classy at one point... it just hasn't been long enough to give off a classic or vintage vibe.\\n\\nOther than maybe the deserts you'll see that the presentation is pretty consistent with most other steakhouses...absent if you know what I mean. I feel like one should be able to dine with their eyes as well... you know... involve all of one's senses.\\n\\nWe all started off by sharing their complimentary bread: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#hnwoRKQPYrn_Sk1XKgOo3w which wasn't bad and served as a pretty good precursor to our impending meal.\\n\\nI then had a bowl of their famous Bean Soup: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#8udUmTWVy5eHpBH03i56Eg I freaking love soup and this one was a very good example of a more rare soup that is available. I really enjoyed this and now really looked forward to my main entree in the form of...\\n\\nTheir Bone-In Ribeye: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#Y94ctMW52aSx_LHDxA2Z8g Now I'm fully aware they are more known for their Prime Rib, but not only am I not as big a fan of PR, but I just prefer the cut of a BIR and its wonderful marbling and flavor it normally possesses. I say normally because this place managed to deliver a steak that was devoid of flavor and just straight up tedious. I did appreciate the fact that my steak was cooked to my requested temperature of \\\"Medium-Rare.\\\" It had some pretty nice grill marks on the outside and was fairly tender. The sides of green beans and baked potato were \\\"ok\\\" at best... again nothing fancy. Normally I would never crave Steak Sauce at a Steakhouse or Chophouse, but found myself wishing I had brought some in an attempt to wake this poor excuse for a piece of meat up! They managed to kill this poor cow twice!\\n\\nTo finish off this meal I felt like I needed something with flavor to make up for what I just consumed so I ordered their Tiramisu: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#6DxGHudL6bhm0iwmePOzaQ which thank goodness was yet another spike up in the graph so to speak. This nice piece of Italian Cake was perfect in every way. it seriously had a nice balance of flavors, textures, colors, that were all rounded out to a beautiful presentation.\\n\\nService while kind was pretty forgettable. Our server did a really good job of conveying the fact that this was a job and any cordiality was more out of obligation.\\n\\nThere is plenty of parking at Circus Circus.\\n\\nOn this night we had received an experience that was totally reflective of the hotel it so comfortably sits in (also affectionately referred to as the \\\"Shits Carlton.)\\n\\nI'm not ready to completely write this place off just yet... I just won't be rushing back with all of the great options in Lost Wages."}

One of my friends got there first and a soon a he sat down at the table in the bar area he was presented by the blonde female bartender with a $150.00 tab. He politely told the girl this wasn't his tab and she proceeded to literally scream at him and fly off the handle.  Luckily the tab owners had just stepped outside for a moment, but from that moment on we had the most terrible service from her. I ordered a margarita and it was disgusting with nothing but mixer and a few cubes of ice. The guys were ordering beers and they literally had to approach the bartender at the bar for two different rounds of beer because the bartender would not return to service our table like she was servicing the rest of them. We had to ask for menus because we were not offered any and anytime we attempted to speak with or get the bar tender's attention she just glared and smirked and acted like everything was just a big inconvenience to her. She was literally snatching money out of out hands while we were paying. Ridiculous."}

I asked for a tea latte with less ice but the girl taking my order just gave me a \\\"sure\\\" without passing on the specification. The barista making my drink gave me a full cup of ice (when I finished, half my cup was still crushed compacted ice) and then didn't bother to wipe down a dripping wet cup after she shook it. Splashes of tea all over my blouse? Not cool.\\n\\nOnly redeeming factor was when I asked to speak with a manager, she offered to refund my beverage and\/or make a new one. I took the refund.

I dig the ambiance and the drive through pick up lane and am betting this concept multiplies quickly.

{"label":2,"text":"I've stayed at the Hyatt a few times in the past (always booked on Hotwire.com for a lot less than the normal rate). The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside (typical 60's stark & practical concrete look of Montreal's downtown) but the rooms are very nice. The bathrooms are stocked with fluffy towels and nice bath products and the bed is really comfortable.\\n\\nIf it was just for the room and the service at the front desk, this place would get a 4 or 4.5 star rating. But there were a few things that bothered me.\\n\\n1. Not sure who the genius was that decided to go with fabric curtains on the inside of the shower instead of plastic, but newsflash idiot, that cotton\/silk blend ABSORBS water. What does that mean? It means that every time I take a shower, there's a giant puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Good thing there were plenty of extra towels every day to mop up the mess.\\n\\n2. The hotel is located in the Complex Desjardins and is above a mall so the lobby is actually located on the 6th floor. This means that from the street or garage, you have to take two sets of elevators to get to your room. Not so bad, but when the hotel is busy, you can wait a while for an elevator.\\n\\n3. I am constantly travelling for work or pleasure, which means lots of nights spent in hotels. One thing I've learned in my travels is that the higher the star rating, the nicer the bed\/bedding and towels are but the more expensive WiFi costs. I've stayed at cheap rundown hotels that smelled like urine (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/days-inn-conference-center-york#hrid:pjiJL4H3qJIYBzwtcNrNOw) that had free WiFi. But the 4 star Hyatt Montreal charges $14\/day for WiFi access. Really Hyatt? With the high cost for a room (standard room rate), you'd think you could include free WiFi.\\n\\nIt's not all bad though. The hotel is located right on Ste Catherine next to the newly renovated festival district. It's right at Place des Arts and a few minutes walk to the old Port or the debauchery that is Ste Catherine street.\\n\\nIn conclusion, use Hotwire.com to book a room in Montreal. You'll likely get the Hyatt for $85\/night, which is worth it. \\n\\nFinaly note directed at hotels in general: Why do you supply fancy moisturizing cremes, which no one uses, but no toothpaste?"}

Now, I had been to the Il Fornaio in Coronado and it was a horrible experience for me (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/il-fornaio-coronado-2#hrid:ba8JuHA3NGLfZWqt9HWEcA). I hurriedly warned my friends about the bad food and slow service for this place's chain, but they brushed me off by assuring me this is the best pasta in town.\\n\\nWrong. Although the service was not as slow as the one in Coronado, the food portions were super small. Because my friend and I knew we didn't want to spend $20+ for a pasta dish here, we had agreed to split, which made the already small portions even smaller. We had some linguine with vodka sauce and it was bland and meh. We each only got to eat around 3 small slices of sausage which were nothing special as well. I only left without remaining hungry because I'd decided to fill my stomach with their bread and dip to get my money's worth.\\n\\nHowever, the worst part came when we were leaving Il Fornaio. While we were waiting for our credit card receipts, one of our friends was looking at the \\\"menu stand\\\" restaurants sometimes have outside for advertisement. Well, he accidentally knocked it over and we discovered what was behind the stand. There was a \\\"C\\\" rating for Il Fornaio's health inspection. WHAT?! I have NEVER been to a C-rated restaurant. And what's worse is that they even tried to hide it with their menu board. Wow, I felt like we had been scammed. \\n\\nIl Fornaio, you have once again disappointed me.

All the things that make an ice cream shop great are present and accounted for.\\n\\n1. They make everything in-house.\\n2. Service is nice!\\n3. A huge variety of flavors, although not necessary. Still nice to see things like taro, black sesame, and Rocher.\\n4. They have boba.\\n5. They can spice up your ice cream with waffles - regular and red velvet!\\n6. They even make their own waffle cones. Pretty easy but cool.\\n7. Stamp cards.\\n8. I'm not sure if this is a plus or not since I haven't tried them but they have egg rolls and other snacks in case you're hungry for something greasy.\\n\\nI got a triple scoop waffle bowl with stracciatella, \\\"Rocher\\\" (yes the golden foil-wrapped chocolates), and Reese's PB cup flavor. The stracciatella was delicious, the Rocher really tasted just like a Rocher! Imagine my surprise. Reese's was a really nice peanut butter flavor with chocolate bits. I really liked all of them! It was all washed down with a Thai tea boba. Boba was good, though I prefer it firmer. It was a little bit away from mushy. Thai tea itself was fine.\\n\\nIf there was anything I didn't like it was the sweetness of the ice cream itself. It was a bit too much for me but I bet most people will be ok with it. Also, I think vegan flavors would be awesome (that aren't just sorbets) since so many people are lactose intolerant! Myself included. It's a tough product to make well, though.\\n\\nI'd be back! I'm thinking about getting the taro flavor right now..."}

{"label":3,"text":"We stayed for  free for a 3 day weekend and pretty much stayed in the hotel experiencing everything it had to offer. Rather than try to capture the whole hotel in a line, I'll try to break it out:\\n\\nRooms (4): As many have said, it's just a Venetian room in brown color tones. I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4\/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.\\n\\nRestaurants\/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.\\n\\nPool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?\\n\\nNightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40\/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy \\\"del toro\\\" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40\/40. boo\\n\\nEase of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.\\n\\nOverall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail. I would especially recommend this place for foodies due to all the yummy restaurants and how easy it is to pass out in your room after a nice meal !"}

The grinder was cheesy and filling, but contained well done pieces of beef and was not that satisfying.  A generous amount of ketchup was provided on request as a dip, which perked up the taste of the sandwich somewhat.

We've had such a blast with her - she's even taken sushi from our table and given it to others, which then got us all laughing and talking. And since it's all you can eat, so what?\\n\\nYes, there are rules, but every a-u-c-e sushi place has them. There isn't anything unreasonable and if you've been to any of the other ones (I can only think of 1 that is still around in that general west-valley area), it's one of the least restrictive. Trust me, you can get belly-busting full without breaking any rules.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, there is an automatic gratuity. I'm also not a big fan of this practice, however, I justify it in my mind that you're not just tipping the server, you're tipping the sushi masters. I never leave without adding additional tip anyways, so it's a become a non-issue for me.\\n\\nGo to get stuffed, or go to try an assortment of different sushi without worrying about paying for something you don't like - it's all good.\\n\\nIf someone in your party doesn't like sushi, they have a regular menu that's pretty typical - teryaki chicken and the like. Enough that it shouldn't stop a non-fish eater from going (but who'd like those people anyways??? LOL!)"}

I'm all for having a few beers while waiting for a table to become available, but it ends up that you are crammed in the bar area for 2 hours, and you end up having too much to drink before you eat.

Again food was great however the customer service I experienced had to be the worse I've ever dealt with in my LIFE!!! I placed my order through the app around 8 pm for pick up at 11:15 pm. I get to Wingstop at exactly 11:13 pm hoping for my food that I had order 3 hours ahead of time. I give Arcoiris my name and I let her know that I'm there to pick up an order. She then says \\\"we don't have anything under your name\\\" I  tell her I placed it over the app. She then knew what I was talking about and told me that order was scheduled to be picked up at 11:15 to which I said \\\"fine I'll wait a minute then\\\" it was then when Arcoiris realized she had fucked up and never placed my order. Even though she had the form right next to the register with a huge note that said place at 11 pm. So now I'm there waiting for my food like an idiot. I didn't get an apology or anything, not even a cup of water. Then once I finally had my food I checked it and  missing 3 rolls so I had to wait another 5 minutes by the time I left Wingstop it was 11:50. I was going to give them a bad review then but I figured I give them a second chance and I did yesterday and same shit horrible service I'm not even going to bother writing about it. All that matters which I find funny is that I learned that Arcoiris the girl who had fucked up my order a week ago is a supervisor!!! So she should of known better the first time. I found out because the girl that rang us up tonight was having issues with our order and had to call her supervisor. Who happened to be her.

A friend had suggested quite a few places for dinner, but none of them seemed overly exciting to him, so we came here.\\n\\nWe came in on a Thursday night around 6:30 and the place was already quite busy. For me, that's a sign of a good place! We were seated at a table, and quite soon afterwards a large party came in, so we all shifted around to give them more seating (which turned out to be a HUGE mistake). \\n\\nWe started with a bottle of English white wine and a cheese plate. It consisted of three cheese. We chose it over the meat and cheese plate solely because that one contained manchego and gorganzola. Both nice cheeses, but nothing special. One of the people at the other table really wasn't paying any attention to anything around her except chatting while trying to get up, so she knocked a bottle of water over onto our cheese plate. They did end up getting us another cheese plate (which hey, it might have been cheese overload, but oh well), which consisted of four cheeses instead of three. And two of them were different. It's a bit strange that they opted to give us the manchego and gorganzola on the second plate in place of one of the cheeses, but maybe they were out.\\n\\nWe then ordered some Italian red wine and the spaghetti with salami in a garlic cream sauce and the ham risotto. It took awhile due to the large table next to us, but we weren't in a hurry so we just enjoyed our wine. The mains were good. We also split the sticky toffee pudding at the end with some port, and that was probably the least good thing of the night. It wasn't sticky enough for me!\\n\\nThe table of twelve next to us kind of ballooned into around 20 by the end. It was a bit too much for such a small restaurant. I kind of wish they told them they couldn't accommodate such a large party, but I don't even think they thought it was going to get as big as it did! \\n\\nThe owner (I think he was the owner, who knows?) came up to us at the end, and he started talking with us a bit about wine.

{"label":3,"text":"I must speak of the wobbly stone.  Every day for three days, I would meet my girlfriend outside of the Edinburgh's Christmas fair (or simply called Edinburgh Christmas--copy\/pasted from here on in).  I found this loose tile in the sidewalk a few feet from the gateway.  It was mildly distracting to balance upon said stone and wobble back and forth while I waited.  I didn't move until she arrived.  And when she did, we would turn and, locked in arms, pass under the arch of the Christmas fair.\\n\\nWhat an amazing stroke of luck.  The day after I arrived in Edinburgh, the Edinburgh Christmas fair opened up.  Occupying most of Princes Street Gardens, the Edinburgh Christmas is basically dozens of booths selling various foods and trinkets with the odd Christmas themed recreational event thrown in for good measure.  This includes an ice rink, a Ferris wheel, a carousel and a theater which I never entered.  The main draws are the booths, dozens of them.  \\n\\nA few other reviews have been critical of the event, claiming that it's lost some its charm.  What these people don't appreciate is how impressive the event is when compared to others found in smaller venues...like my home town.  What I'm saying is that even if the Edinburgh Christmas has lost some appeal, it still remains an amazing attraction if one finds him or herself in Edinburgh in the winter.  What I appreciate the most is that the Edinburgh Christmas caters to those wishing to wander in a chilly but not uncomfortable evening for a few hours looking for unique experiences to enjoy.  I strolled through the fair several times during my vacation and found it satisfying each time.  \\n\\nI admit there is considerable duplication; several vendors market identical items such as candle holders and hats at identical prices.  However, there are still numerous unique booths you'd have to search to find.  Only one sells authentic big pretzels while another singular table sells novelty notebooks and iPad covers.  I bought three wheels of cheese from one vender near the entrance.  A personal favorite were a pair of boisterous men with beards selling various foreign chocolates, exclaiming them to the passing crowds.  Excluding the novelty shops, I must take moment to talk about the food venders, selling everything from mulled wine, to cotton candy, to French crepes drenched in molten nutella, to bratwurst as long as your arm.  Although some people refer to this as a German festival, I noticed as many representations from the Netherlands.  I enjoyed poffertjes and the aforementioned French crepes drenched in hazelnut chocolate sauce.  The girlfriend and I took a ride on the Ferris wheel, lifting us into an amazing vista of Edinburgh's horizon a few minutes after sunset.  \\n\\nAnd it feels like Christmas.  \\n\\nI bought the novelty notebook.  I bought the wheels of cheese.  I enjoyed the Polish krakowska.  If I had more time, I could have purchased more, eaten more, regardless of how disappointing this festival was over others which Edinburgh boasts.  I would have taken the girlfriend on the carousel she so badly wanted to ride.  \\n\\nIf this what accounts for a small fair--a disappointing fair--then I cannot wait to return to Edinburgh in the future and see what their good fairs look like."}

And to be honest, if I had to choose, I'd much rather take my money over to Hometown now that it will be less crowded OR starve. \\n\\nWe arrived five minutes to 6, and the line was already out the door.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we made it to the cash register.  We were able to take advantage of the 2 for $20 special.  The promotion starts after 4 pm, Monday thru Thursday.  The third person had to pay the regular price, eh, no big deal.  We were seated fairly quickly after we paid.  \\n\\nFood was just okay, maybe slightly better than HTB, but not by much.  That cotton candy machine brings a nice touch to the dessert station, but it is super sticky that I did not bother with it.  Everything else was overly sweet.  \\n\\nService was just okay as well.  Our server forgot to refill my brother's soda, and she never bothered to ask if I needed refill with my water.  I think the drink station should be made accessible to make things easier for all of us.  \\n\\nI can't say I was too disappointed with this place as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  So if you go in with that attitude, then you'll be alright."}
{"label":0,"text":"the amount of food and the quality is ok for the price.  the interior is large, clean, and can accomodate large groups.  \\n\\nBUT\\n\\ni was also there at 8:30 and was made to order before i even sat down.  the waiter made me feel like if i didn't order right that second i wouldn't be able to eat at all.  we were in a large group and gave them a lot of business, so i think they should have been a little more accommodating as far as giving us some time to think about what we wanted to eat.  i was also told to order from the very limited menu b\/c anything else would take too long to cook.  then we saw everyone who ordered off the regular menu get their food waaaay before we did.  \\n\\nwe ordered 5 orders of the bul go gi and 1 order of the seafood bul go gi.  they decided to lump in that 5th order of regular bul go gi in with the seafood one b\/c they didn't feel like cooking that one separately.  they didn't even ask us first if that was ok.  just really careless service."}

They have a hidden patio which we enjoyed. \\n\\nI would have loved to give it a 4 star rating but they still have some room for improvement. I just ordered water (in a glass) and it was horrible, it tasted like sewer water. I could have gotten iced tea was but the pitcher was very cloudy, maybe it wasn't, but it looked nasty and at $7.50 for a sandwich with no sides I couldn't see adding a couple more dollars to it for a drink. \\n\\nSo, the drinks are lacking and the price is a bit high but we will go back to give it another try because it has a LOT of other qualities that we loved!"}

I ordered the beef chow fun and garlic chicken on Saturday night and both were sub-par. \\n\\nThe beef chow fun was not good. The noodles stuck together and the veggies didn't seem fresh. It also tasted like someone just dunk a ton of soy sauce over the flat noodles. It was not appetizing at all.\\n\\nMy beau ordered the garlic chicken and it was not spicy whatsoever even though I asked them to make it spicy. \\n\\nIf you're looking for good Chinese food, I suggest Chen Wok.

The drinks however usually don't disappoint although on our last visit the Sangria was terrible. I am not sure if the bartender made it wrong but it was way too sweet and not nearly enough wine was in it. I had to send it back and go with a Mojito that was OK. \\nI will say that I do love the concept and the setting of the establishment. It has a good vibe and great for Happy Hour!"}

{"label":0,"text":"I wish that I could give a negative star. Honestly, I never wanted century link in the first place. However, my apartments are contracted with them and try as I might no other service would agree to bend the rules and sign me up. I hate century link because 1.) No, you can not make a payment 24\/7. You have to schedule it for a later time. 2.) If you are one day late, you are shut off immediately. However, once you make a payment you have to wait 4-24 hours to  get it back. 3.) Which this far has meant 24 hours although they have no problem pulling the money from my account immediately. 4.) They do not offer 24 hour support, their offices close at 6pm. 5.) It took me 2+ weeks to get it all hooked up because I was told 3 different things by 3 different people about what kind of modem I needed, which turned out to be only theirs. But lucky me, I can rent instead of buy! So over a years period, I will have paid for a modem that I can't keep. The alternative being to buy their modem, which why would I want to? So I can have a modem that only works for century link? Hahaha, no thank you. 6.) they refused to adjust my bill for the 2 weeks I paid for no internet due to customer service incompetence. They even hung up on me. 7.) Internet as low as $19.95? Bull, \\\"oh I'm sorry, your area code does not qualify\\\". Then why is there a billboard two blocks from me advertising it? If you're thinking about switching to century link, don't!"}

Sen of Japan is about a 15 minute drive west of the strip. \\n\\nThe food and service in the past has been spot on and tonight was no exception. Both waitresses who served me were awesome. They never let my hot tea go empty and for the amount of food consumed - what a bargain! Started off with popcorn shrimp with orange Aioli sauce, Black miso cod with butter lettuce, Fresh water eel roll, Black snapper sushi, #1 roll spicy albacore with tuna and spicy garlic ponzu and finished up with house made red bean ice cream.

I am sure it wasn't on purpose but when 2 tables are seated after me and served drinks and their appetizers before the server acknowledges me, that is a problem.  \\n\\nThe first time I walked out, the second time I waived my hands in the air to make sure to get their attention.  We sat at the same table both times, it could be a cursed table.\\n\\nThe hostess is always very sweet and friendly.  However, I won't be back unless friends have a burning desire to go.

{"label":2,"text":"A small restaurant near the eastern end of Roy. There are two types of seating, hard old wooden chairs with backs that surround you on three sides and bar stools at raised tables. The decor is eclectic and anemic. In some ways it feels like a garage sale of items. The food is advertised as tapas and yet, can you really call something tapas if the style is French? Isn't that really more of an amuse bouche, then? Anyway. most of the tapas were nice and the prices were reasonable, with the exception of the beef tartare which on the night we had it, had an off flavour related to the spices. The alcohol prices were a little high, but still acceptable. The soft drink prices apparently were set by someone from Paris or a stripper, because at $4 for a soft drink, I expect someone to be dancing around nearly naked (or at least be on the Champ d'Elysee, with a snooty accented French.) Makes you wonder who is setting the prices, because a glass of milk is just $3, but cost wise is more than any softdrink. Of note, the Fennel salad was excellent. The creme brulee was nicely prepared. The chevre chaud was too sweet for my taste. The salmon was good. But I would skip the tartare. Oh and the Piano man was quite good."}
{"label":1,"text":"I may not be back like previously stated.\\n\\nThe last two times I got take out food, the chips tasted like they had been cooked in rancid oil and the salsa was waaay too salty.

They ended up changing our room to another suite (not the same one as booked) which was ok but I still wanted to be booked in the room with the jacuzzi. The hotel is beautiful and the food was good so I think they just need a better check in system because it took them FOREVER to figure out the situation once we told them the room they gave us was already occupied. Shouldn't take 30 minutes to decide what to do."}
{"label":1,"text":"so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \\\"susies mexican cafe\\\" in east tempe. take the drive!"}

I'm sure we're not the only people paying with cash on the strip. Get over it and take the money.

Would recommend this place to cure the craving, but didnt look like they had fresh coffee, and just a case in the corner with a few drink choices.  Someone on here bagged this place for having to big of servings, dude seriously-GIVE ME EXTRA DESSERT ANYTIME! Shoot the pastry was only $5 and seriously why would you complain about a big tasty dessert?  They will let you take it home if you cant finish it, and if you cant finish one dessert, you probably arent worthy of this site, or writting any blogs food related.

The food was very small portioned, flavorless, and I couldn't even finish his taquitos & I was still hungry. We paid $4.50 for the ''special'', and got 2 TINY dry taquitos.

And a line it was: we waited for a long time;  the food was doled out very slowly as the people in line texted and tweeted on their phones in anticipation. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting in line, a girl leaned out of the taco truck to erase \\\"suckling pig\\\" from the chalkboard menu. They seem to make one unusual taco variety at a time, at least this particular festival. Some people gave up and forfeited their place in line in favor of easier-to-acquire food.\\n\\nBut I persevered, and was rewarded with a taco of the new flavour:  chorizo, black beans, and ranch salad. Very tasty, a great combination of flavours and textures, satisfying and filling. But I'm not sure it was worth 25 minutes in line.\\n\\nI would definitely try the tacos again, preferably in a non-festival, less crowded moment. They supposedly show up at Nouveau Palais (281 Bernard Ouest) every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from midnight - 3AM.

I declined any further offers for corrections and left hungry in fear if a lugee being launched in my food. That was only my meal.\\nMy boyfriend ordered fish and chips (at a pizza place, I have no idea why). His one request was for coleslaw as a side, he never got it....even after multiple requests....big surprise. He was also looking forward to the savory vinegar described on the menu that would coat his fries...that was not present either, even after he asked again for it. To the managers credit, she did comp our meals (even though I never got one) and gave us a gift certificate for a future visit.\\nWe decided to give it another try tonight and ran into the same issues...slow service, wrong orders and being blamed when the wrong stuff is brought out. I have honestly lost respect for my sister and brother in law for recommending this place and all of the other patrons who frequent this establishment. Shame on you!"}

{"label":4,"text":"We landed late and headed straight from the hotel to KGB.  I had wanted to try this place for awhile but the last time out they were closed for a week.  So we got over to Harrahs about midnight and went to finally get this burger that I feared I was overhyping in my head.  Hostess was friendly, sat us and the decor was pretty cool.  The outfits are very enjoyable for us guys.  No complaints there.  The late night menu does not have everything I had seen on the normal menu.  However they do have a late night deal with a cheeseburger, fries, and soda for 9.99.  My wife got that, I opted for the double cheeseburger with bacon, carmelized onions, and russian dressing which I got on the side.  They asked if you want it medium or well.  I chose medium.  It came quickly and it was unbelievable.  Im happy to see their medium is medium rare like I love.  This burger tasted so good that I feel like Marshall on How I Met Your Mother where he dreams of that one burger place that he went to and he can't remember where it was, but he knows how amazing it was.  That's how I feel about this burger.  I miss it so much, and I've been thinking about it for days since I got back and I wish it was here with me right now.  Luckily unlike Marshall I know where to go to get that burger.  The burger was so juicy, it was covered in bacon.  I've never seen so much bacon on a burger.  And the fries were fresh cut and outstanding.  Im not even a big fry fan but these were tasty.  I highly endorse this place.  Stop by KGB have a burger, enjoy the waitress getups, and put it on your itinerary for your next trip."}

They turned out to be just as good as the chocolate (which is a bit surprising, since chocolate tends to trump all things). They did bot skimp at all on the blueberries, these were just chock full of them.\\n\\nThough my pancakes were delcious, the service did not match. It was quite mediocre. Although that may have been because the baby started crying every time the server came by (she's very attached to me)- I would be hesitant to regularly check on a table that a baby cried every time I came close too. The server only came by to take our order and drop off our food.\\n\\nI'll come back because I'm a huge fan of pancakes."}
{"label":3,"text":"What a great find in Las Vegas! Initially, I didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places I've been to have impressed me as much as Ramen Dojo in NorCal. Knowing that the capacity of Monta Noodle House fit around 20 or so customers, I anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a Friday afternoon. Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting. \\n\\nMonta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD! \\n\\nIf you're ever craving ramen in Las Vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! It's located in Chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. Solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in VEGAS!!\\n\\nFYI: I also heard that the kimchee fried rice was also good to try. \\n\\nHappy Eating =)"}

{"label":3,"text":"4 stars, because I'm a little picky with my 5 stars for when places make me want to hustle rides and instigate with people to get back somewhere.\\n\\nThe pesto chicken was decent like others said (I prefer D'Lish's more), and the tuna melt makes me want to rethink my strategy on healthy food and add more gooey, melty cheese to things...\\nbut what stood out to me as more \\\"craving worthy\\\" was the avocado turkey. The croissant was buttery and flaky and had really nice flavors with the aioli and avocado. So good.\\nI did try the California toast and wasn't the biggest fan of the sundried tomatoes on top... just something about them. But I like that any menu item with avocado usually has a generous helping of it.\\n\\nI really like the hummus too (and the pita bread pieces that come with it, though don't let them get cold or else they'll be hard as rocks)- it's plain hummus with the sauce of your choice drizzled at the bottom of the cup and on top. I tried the garlic and the prickly heat (though it's a lot more sweet than spicy) and both were tasty. The garlic wasn't \\\"my coworkers are going to hate me in our afternoon meeting\\\" strong, so luckily they can just hate me for calling afternoon meetings. For $2.50 it was a nice side to my sandwich to make my meal of sandwich+hummus more filling.\\nYou'll probably find that it's \\\"just enough\\\" food - you won't get stuffed or squelch a ravenous appetite.\\n\\nI've tried a sample of their Java Mocha Blast and it was pretty good. There are similar drinks at Coffee Plantation and D'Lish, so much so that it gets hard to rank them but this one has a stronger coffee flavor and adds Nutella for their own unique twist to the peanut butter+banana+mocha.\\n\\nOh and it might be good to note that they serve the full menu the whole time they're open, so maybe next time I'll grab breakfast at lunchtime.\\n\\nOne downside is that they seem to run out of the hummus often by lunchtime :("}

A young woman who looked like the owner said something to me but I wasn't able to hear because the restaurant was right next to a busy street.

{"label":1,"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance and two other dining companions.  We had made reservations earlier in the week and arrived at the restaurant right around the time of our reservations and were immediately seated.  The hostess took us through a cool looking bar area and into a back room that had two tables for 4 and a lounge area.  It was a pretty cool space and the lounge area looked like it could fit right into the Mad Men TV show or maybe even a bit earlier.  \\n\\nAs we sat down, we were given our menus.  Since it was Pittsburgh Restaurant week they had a special going where you could get an appetizer, entree and dessert for $25 and gave three options for each.  Beyond that, I can't really say that there was much of a menu besides a bar snacks section which left me disappointed.  Long before we got there our dining companions had let us know that they would be about 15 minutes later than our reservation for dinner.  As such I decided to order from the bar snacks portion while we waited for them and so we started off with the popcorn which that night ended up being a dill covered popcorn.  It ended up being really good with a decent amount of butter on it and a generous serving of dill.  For dinner I decided to have the spicy chicken as my appetizer, a pasta as my entree and then a vegan gingersnap ice cream sandwich filled with peaches and cream ice cream.  One of my dining companions asked how the ice cream was vegan and I believe that they replied that it was made with tofu instead of diary.  My meal started off well as the spicy chicken had a good spice level to it.  It was actually much spicier than I had been expecting but that is a good thing to for me as I love my food to be spicy.  Next up was the pasta which was quite a disappointment.  There was barely any sauce on it I honestly could not taste any of the flavors that they had on the menu.  Normally I like just about everything that I eat but I don't care for wasting calories on something that is bland and doesn't taste like much.  Finally I had the dessert.  It was, well interesting may be the best word.  Whenever it came out to us the ice cream was melting which was fine and I dove right into it.  The taste was not that great although not bad either and I wish that I could describe it but I don't know that I have ever had anything comparable to it.  At least the ginger snaps were good as they were a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back to Tender in the future.  I honestly can't say that the food was terrible, but it wasn't nearly worth the money that we spent on it.  Beyond that their menu was very limited and if they had posted the actual menu that they were serving on the restaurant week website instead of a sample one from which they were only minor similarities, I do not believe that we would have gone there.  At least the service was good and the ambiance of the place nice"}
{"label":3,"text":"Bottom line: there's room for improvement but this new little place is off to a great start.\\n\\nMy wife and I finally tried Sa Bai after a good review from a friend. We weren't disappointed. We had two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert. The appetizers were good but not great - the crab wontons were tasty but a little too saucy for me; the crispy thai rolls were a bit generic - a little oily, lacking some in flavor.\\n\\nHowever, the main dishes more than made up for this. We had the pad prik king, and pad see-iew. Wow! Both were flavorful and perfectly spiced - not overwhelming, just enough to enhance the flavors and give a little kick. We both really, really liked these dishes. \\n\\nDeserts were again good but not overwhelmingly awesome. The prices are reasonable, moreso if you get the happy hour pricing on drinks and appetizers. Service was excellent, btw. Friendly and timely.\\n\\nWe will definitely be coming back to SaBai, and look forward to working our way through more of the menu."}
{"label":2,"text":"Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype.

Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:\\n\\nThe wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)\\n\\nThe Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment. \\n\\nThe Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a Brussels Sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.\\n\\nThat's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. \\n\\nEven my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service.

Additionally, the pot stickers were likely pre-made, nuked in a microwave and then lightly fried in a pan.  Really not good pot stickers.   You will have better asian food at Panda Express, sorry.

I really don't like when businesses mix religion with their product, I think it's really annoying and offensive.

Order the 4 choice of meat ( brisket, rib, sausage, pork ), fried pickle, Mac and cheese, green beans. \\n\\nFood was better than the last BBQ place I had gone to, but hey I'm from Texas I know what real BBQ taste like. The brisket was good, everything else was meh. Mac and cheese was not great, fried pickle was good. \\n\\nService was horrible, i didn't get to put in my drink order, she left to get the first order of drink rather than waiting for 3 people to put in a request. When we were done eating our food we were waiting to get our server attention to get a to go box. But what was funny how we asked a server who wasn't our server,didn't want to get it for us.  He pointed where our server was, who happen to see she should attend our services. Not only that but our server was so stupid that when we asked for the check she said can I get you another beer. Had you checked on us earlier maybe, but not when we asked for the check. Duh, common sense.\\n\\nServers eat in front of the customers, they mingle and drink in front of our faces and you see the hostess flirting with the bar backs. Had I known this was a mingle for people who hated their jobs and wanted to hang out, I would have gotten my food to go and and not see a social place where people just want to sleep with each other after work. \\n\\nP.s we were the only table they were serving!"}

{"label":4,"text":"I have lived at Riverwalk now for about 3 years in a purchased one bedroom condo that I am still in love with!  Its about time I wrote my raving review!! \\n\\nAbout the Condos: \\n- Both one or two bedroom condos are very spacious\\n- Very large balconies\\n- Outdoor storage space on the balcony\\n- Built in bookshelves\\n- Large windows for lots of natural light\\n- Tall ceilings\\n- Large tub\/ shower- perfect for relaxing bubble baths\\n- 3rd floor condos have a wood burning fireplace\\n- Nice large tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms\\n- large dogs and other animals are allowed\\n- gated complex\\n- pool and hot tub\\n- work out facility \\n- covered parking spot and some garages available for extra $\\n\\nOverall the condos are wonderful! Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, most of the appliances have been updated to stainless steel.  In addition to the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, most condos have either carpet or have been upgraded to wood flooring.  In all honesty when I was first looking at these condos they are similar to the neighboring complex, Red Rox.  However, Riverwalk has larger balconies and their exterior is painted a nice neutral white and tan, compared to Red Rox, which is a red and green color and always reminds me of christmas.      \\n\\nIn addition to the condos, I feel the location of these condos is fabulous! Located right on the border of Tempe and Phoenix; and Scottsdale is less than 5 minutes away.  Papago Park is right across the street for nice scenery, hiking and biking.  The Oakland A's baseball stadium is in walking distance for Spring Training games.  Also, the Phoenix Zoo is about a block away, next to the Botanical Gardens.  Right down the road is the Marquee Theater, the light rail, and Mill Ave.  Very easy to get anywhere you want to go from these condos!"}
{"label":0,"text":"Save your money- go to Panda Express. That's a shame I feel Panda Express is higher quality than this place. I ordered teriyaki chicken, shrimp chow mien, orange chicken, egg rolls and white rice. First red flag was the broken soft drink fountain they had - the lemonade just produced the syrup, no actual lemonade. The orange chicken was obviously stale. The meat was like chewing plastic. The teriyaki chicken was disgusting, how hard is it to at least pour some teriyaki sauce over some grilled chicken, at the least. The sauce they use is a  gravy of some sort, I could honestly place it on top a bed of mashed potatoes. The white rice was hard and must have been a leftover batch from yesterday or hours before. The egg rolls were mediocre, a little greasy but whatever. The only thing that was decent was the shrimp chow mien, there were only 4 or 5 shrimp (large order) but at least the taste was there. This was my first and most definitely my last visit to \\\"NO NO NO\\\"!"}

My boyfriend ordered the cashew chicken for the first time and he loved it. My friend got chicken fried rice and that was good as well. The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. \\n\\nI'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said \\\"I'm too lazy to make a real one,\\\" as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. \\n\\nThe food was good, the atmosphere not so much.

Dark, dismal, and there were still Christmas decorations up. The darkness was more reminiscent of a lounge than a family restaurant. We ordered one of the daily specials and were pleased. The food was freshly prepared, hot, and plentiful. I give it a 4.  That being said, I would probably only visit here again in a pinch.

{"label":2,"text":"This was my first visit to 40 West Steakhouse. My impression upon entering the restaurant was that Montreal has finally found its place among some of the better-known steak establishments in the U.S. We were greeted by an attractive group of hostesses and were seated in a prompt and courteous manner. \\n\\nThe food was presented very well by our waiter, and the quality of service went downhill from there. One of the members of my party was shown a rib steak in its raw form and instead received a much less impressive and fattier version. And as if that were not enough, halfway through our meal someone decided to reduce the lighting in the restaurant by about 50%, after which we had to almost beg for a candle for our table so that we could see what we were eating.\\n\\nFrom a condescending response to how two members of our party requested their meat be cooked; to ignoring numerous requests for more butter; to having to hunt down a bus person to ask for fresh-ground pepper; to our request for plain water and serving us Evian instead, our waiter left the building. He definitely put a cloud over our experience. \\n\\nService notwithstanding, the food was absolutely delicious. My NY strip was one of the best I ever had. My brother's lamb chops were enjoyable too. \\n\\nI would give 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service, therefore an overall rating of 3 stars is justified in my opinion. \\n\\nOne small aside: the presence of a large flat-screen TV diminishes the authentic steakhouse ambience."}
{"label":1,"text":"While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \\\"forgot\\\" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \\\"harried\\\" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \\\"encounter\\\".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes. \\nThe Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.

The haggis itself wasn't that flavorful, and the chili-jam was sweet but didn't really have much heat.  The mushroom-kidney bean pate was quite nice, however the oat-cakes were mysteriously missing from the plate.

{"label":2,"text":"I really loved Dr. Wareing when I had her. She was is super kind and attentive. She tended to ask a couple of times during the appointment, \\\"Do you have any other questions?\\\" She wanted to make sure I wasn't sitting at home worrying about anything. She has very good communication skills. The office staff has always been very kind in my experience as well.\\n\\nBut looking back at my experience I realized I wish she had been more cautious about my situation. I was having contractions for months. At my 36th week appointment she said I was dilated to 3 cm, offered to strip my membranes, but said she was going to send me to the hospital anyway, (and by the way, \\\"you know I'm going out out of the country tomorrow, right?). She acted like having the baby before 37 weeks was no big deal. This was my first, and I liked her, and I didn't know what to think so I just trusted my doctor. She did say that the baby might have problems latching, but sort of down played it. I don't know if she really didn't think it was that big of a deal or if she really thought I was going to have that baby that day and was trying not to stress me out. But the reality is when I got to the hospital and I wasn't dilating any more, instead of sending me home she broke my water and I had the baby later that night. I wouldn't say that she pressured me to have the baby early, but I was a first time mom and I needed someone to tell me what the smartest\/safest thing to do was. I didn't really get that.\\n\\nFor people that have complained that she only takes women who are pregnant, I can tell you that she probably already has too many patients as it is and you'd do better elsewhere. I would sometimes wait for an hour or more in the office if she was delivering a baby or something (only one Dr in the office and all). Plus, when I moved out of town and tried to get them to move my records. I have never had such a battle in my life. The (very kind) nurse at the desk said she was really sorry but Dr. Wareing had been delivering babies \\\"non-stop, getting no sleep\\\" that week and hadn't had time to sign off on my records. Finally my husband had to call and threaten to go all the way to Phoenix and stand in their office until they gave us the records. The sent them the next day. It took them 29 days."}

Oh and it came with toast and 3 different jams but it was this nasty hard wheat bread! Gross, but I'm sorry but when its late at night I just want some delicious soft white bread. However, considering where they are located (Cosmopolitan) their prices were pretty reasonable ( 2 omelets and a bloody Mary for about $60 not including tip).

{"label":2,"text":"I've been here for brunch before and it was amazing! However, I was disappointed by a recent trip for a friend's bday. \\n\\nWe had a big group and hung out in the bar area, standing\/mingling, and occupied the three tall, center tables. It was a Monday night and the service was EXTREMELY slow. It looked like the server, in addition to the bar area, was also responsible for some tables in the dining room.\\n\\nI ordered a drink and it arrived about 20 minutes later. A friend ordered food at the same time and his food arrived about 10 minutes before my drink. And we were sitting right next to the bar! The drink did not fit the description on the menu (it sounded like a martini, based on the description, but ended up being some sweet concoction served in a wine glass) and I sent it back (something I very rarely do). I asked for a different drink and it arrived, another 15 minutes later.\\n\\nThe dinner small plate and entree options leave much to be desired. With a large group, we wanted to order a few shareable plates, but all the small plates on the menu did not seem very sharing-friendly. Also, why does EVERYTHING have bacon?? The entrees seemed very over priced (tilapia for $22, are you kidding me?). \\n\\nI would definitely return for brunch, but never for dinner or drinks."}
{"label":2,"text":"This is a great place to buy makeup or skincare, I love that they have pretty much everything (except Laura Mercier?)- \\nAs far as the salon goes, I've had different experiences here.  One senior stylist did a great job on a cut ( I think she was the director), another senior stylist did an OK job, and I've had some bad cuts as well, when I left feeling like I didn't get what I paid for.  I had great highlights a few times there (senior stylist), and both times I really stressed how much I liked that they didn't turn out brassy, but nobody bothered to write down what they used on my card.   When I went back for the third time to get highlights, the (Jr. Stylist) girl just used whatever they had, it turned out brassy. I knew I was in trouble when she said \\\"we'll just use a toner.\\\" For some reason, that never helps (I think because my hair is so naturally dark, and they need to use a blue-based bleach and\/or leave it on longer to process). Really, it's not my business to know that much detail, it's theirs, but I've been in self-protection mode lately, trying to figure out what went wrong so it won't happen again. This salon can also get a bit gossipy and is less professional than some others, and I never felt \\\"pampered\\\" in the salon.  If you choose to give this place a try, I would recommend paying more and going with a senior stylist. I did notice another reviewer who loved this place, and her hair looks great in the pic, so I think it just depends on who you get.  Like I said though, it's a great place to buy cosmetics."}

EVER ( And no I am not be over dramatic). ok, fine, i will give it 1\/16 of a star for the pricing, which should have been an indicator of what was to come. \\n\\nLets start off by saying there is absolutely no point to look on their website to judge what your room experience may be. That would be a complete waste of your time. The website does not resemble to room at all. First, the room is completely depressing, barely any lighting and really big, dark furniture. Don't expect to cover up with a cozy comforter, oh that's right, you just get a sheet to cover up with. So at night ( during the peak of summer) you can either sleep with your AC and freeze, or turn it low or off and toss and turn all night b\/c your so freaking hot. \\n\\nLadies, don't plan on straightening your hair (which we all know if an absolute essential). That would just be too much to ask. Why you wonder. Well, the moment I plugged in my small straightener, the breaker went off and the bathroom went dark... TWICE and as a result my expensive beauty essential went dead. I made a claim with the hotel and after sending a security guard (WTF) to my room, I was told that the hotel was not at fault and I was just going to have to deal.\\n\\nThe nicest part of the room, I reckon, would be the bathroom... if you like to find a cockroach waiting for you in the morning as you walk into the shower...... seriously!\\n\\nI would have rather stayed at Hooters, at least I would have left smelling of chicken wings!!!!"}

It came with a catalina style dressing that we really disliked, and so that was a total waste of two otherwise nice looking side salads. So for $8+, we ended up with just some curry, a small side of rice, and a very small roll...not exactly a deal.

I went in to establish myself as a new patient and get an annual physical which is covered by my insurance but the next thing I know they submitted it as a particular ailment and told me I owed them money!  I explained that they submitted it wrong and it should be covered and that's when the nasty staff gloves came off.  They were yelling at me, telling me they didn't have to provide me with information they provided to my insurance, didn't have to provide me with my visit information, etc.  The doctors heard this crazy conversation that the nasty office staff was having and not one of  them came out to apologize or stop the problem.  In the meanwhile the staff started hurling personal insults and being condescending to me.

{"label":0,"text":"I notice a few reviewers out there having the \\\"is it authentic?\\\" debate when it comes to Mexican restaurants. My first concern with Mexican food is the same as it is with any cuisine, and that's \\\"is it good?\\\". It's just as easy to make bad Mexican food as it is any other food, but I find so much of it out there, both here in Pittsburgh and in the rest of the country. So much so, in fact, that I had decided to write off eating at Mexican restaurants unless I'm in Chicago, NYC or So Cal, as I've been disappointed so often. The reviews here on Yelp made me think things might be different here at Cal. Taco Shop. Not.\\nI started with chips and salsa. The chips were a little greasy, but not really bad...it's the salsa that had me shaking my head. It reminded me of a can of RO*TEL diced tomatoes with green chiles dumped into a molcajete. I don't know to what extent this salsa is homemade, but it seemed to me not at all. They do offer three different pureed salsas at a table where you pick up your fork and napkin, and I found the salsa verde to be alright. I used that on my chips. I ordered chicken enchiladas in mole for my main. Most of us in this country know mole as chocolate sauce, but they can be best defined as chile based sauces thickened with nuts and seeds. These sauces are different all over Mexico, as regional cuisine in that country has stayed really well preserved. Mexican chocolate is used as a flavoring ingredient in some moles, but, when used, is one of up to 80 ingredients that go into the sauce. The mole that most restaurants here in the U.S. attempt to replicate is mole rojo, which hails from the state of Oaxaca. When done right, it's nutty and spicy with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. The mole at California Taco Shop was very one note and overly sweet. There's a ready to use mole paste in a jar out there, Dona Maria Mole Adobo from Hormel, that tastes and looks alot like this mole. My conjecture is that many restaurants use it, as making mole is an all day affair. I don't know if that's what they're doing here, but I am saying that this mole tastes like that. They top their enchiladas in mole with queso anejo, which was the only good thing about them. The refried beans were flavorless and uninteresting. I would say that I'll go back and try other dishes here, but I didn't dine alone, so saw some of the other offerings. It's just not good quality food. It's not being prepared with care, and the ingredients are sub par. They may make their own tortillas, but mine were buried in bad mole, so I can't comment on their attributes. Not. Going. Back."}

I have never seen such a sports plaza and was impressed thru and thru. Arizonians should be very proud of that set up. Although San Jose's HP Pavilion is 2 times as big as Jobing.com arena, San Jose cant even hold candle to what surrounds the Glendale Arena.

From bars, to restaurants, to shopping, to waterfalls, to jumbo-trons, to a 25' inflatable hockey player... AMAZING. \\n\\n2nd, the Coyote fans were wonderful and very tactful. As much as I hear that Coyotes don't have much of a following, their arena was sold out. Probably about 20% Shark fans, but sold out none the less. Now, if the Coyotes would have won that night, perhaps the ghettoness of their fans may have came out, but they didn't, so I probably will never know how hardcore those fans are. \\n\\n3rd, the jobing.com arena is small. Long line for refreshments. You cant get back to your seat in between periods in time. Just so you know. \\n\\nAnyway, so yes. Arizonians be proud. Embrace hockey.

Fail! \\n\\nFriend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.\\n\\nThe wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some \\\"fruity tart\\\" type flavored white wine. She said it was \\\"tinny\\\" tasting and not good. Fail.\\n\\nThe pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs. \\n\\nThe paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head. \\n\\nI will not be back!"}

Once again, delicious, with melt-in-your-mouth tender cubes of meat, and the lovely contrast of raw onions and cabbage.\\n\\ntheir tortilla chips? not that great...they were too hard, too greasy, although they did have a good amount of salt. I had them with their salsa...very spicy and smoky, but it was more of a bean salsa(not chunky, but a powerful flavor of beans...not my thing)."}
{"label":1,"text":"It's not as good as you hope. It's not a real pub. And the food is less than mediocre. I guess the real reason to stop in is for the beer.

Its an interesting mix of street performers, historical sites, and new technology.  Its a little seedy, but the strip has a little seedy too.  We took public transportation there and while cheaper, it took forever.  We took a cab back and it was a much more enjoyable experience.  \\n\\nI liked the vibe of the restaurants and bars here.  Everything is more affordable.  Things are less opulent and less clean, but a lot more comfortable.  I like the throw back vibe to everything, it felt like stepping back in time.  Nobody here takes themselves too seriously as it is Vegas after all.  I really liked the restaurants and bar here, there are some very nice restaurants, but again cheaper then the strip and with a more historical ambiance.  The video screen is very cool too!"}
{"label":0,"text":"Not impressed...not even happy. \\n\\nMy gal pal and I did a day of beauty, got our hair colored and decided to doll up and do our nails as well. \\n\\nThis nail salon is by her house so we thought would give it a shot. \\n\\nI got basic acrylic nails done, was feeling Vampy so went with long and cherry red. The Co-owner (husband) worked on my nails. \\n\\nThis could very well be the worst nail job I have ever had in my years of Vamping beauty. He did a sloppy job attaching the nails, super glue all over my hands...bad. The polish job was sad, after he sloppily polished my nails he then spent 10 minutes cleaning off the polish residue from the sides of my fingers with a brush and nail polish remover. I could have done a better job using my left hand! \\n\\nHe has no business doing nails. This to me is just cheap, for the sake of not having to pay an additional employee. This will cost him business which will be a lot more than what he would pay a skilled nail technician.\\n\\nSure you may have customer's come in for the first time, but what if they don't return? Then what? There is a nail shop on every corner, why would I return to a place that does a crappy job? I won't!\\n\\nHe bragged of being a proud family business, that means nothing if you have unskilled family members working. He even had his 14 year old daughter working doing pedicures. That is just not professional to me. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.\\n\\nMy friend had her nails done by his Wife, I have to say she did a kick ass job on her nails! My friend got the pink and white solar nails. Awesome! They look stunning! \\n\\nA turn off is that I did notice the lady doing pedicures used the same foot scrubber on two different customers. Not once did I see any cleaning or sterilization being done between customer's! NOOOOOOOOOOO! Bad Bad Bad. \\n\\nThe place could have been a lot cleaner, luckily for them the health department did not swing by and do an inspection as it would not have been good! \\n\\nIf you go here...AVOID pedicures and ONLY have the Co-owner (Wife) work on your nails. The Husband is not skilled in acrylics! \\n\\nYou have been warned."}

Good, but not great, nothing special. And that basically summarizes my feelings about Oregano's.\\n\\nSo I came here with a friend. He claims it's one of his favorite Italian restaurants and Italian is pretty hard to mess up so why not? Tagging along... We step into the restaurant. Colors green and red everywhere! Digging the atmosphere! Digging the old school vintage vibes! Jukeboxes and checkered floors and walls adorned with paintings and dim lights! It's wonderful! So an A+ for decor! But then again, I am not an interior decorator. So what do I know?\\n\\nMoving on to the food! I ordered a pasta called Alfredo the Dark. It came with spiral pasta drenched in cream sauce, diced tomatoes and poblano chillies. Underneath the pasta were 4 slices of bread, made infinitely more appetizing by the fact that it was sitting beneath the pasta and soaking up ALL the cream sauce. Divine!\\n\\nThe chicken in the pasta was well seasoned and roasted. The pasta itself, while a solid pasta, wasn't mind-blowing. Delicious and safe. Too safe. The poblano chillies did not have much of an impact on the dish which was very disappointing. In fact, the dish wasn't spicy in the least. But other than that, you know. Chicken pasta with cream sauce. It was good! You can't screw it up. I just wish the poblano chillies had challenged me.\\n\\nGood thing about this place is that the service was fantastic. Also, the portion sizes are pretty decent too. My ~$12 pasta became 2 whole meals for me so that's always nice! \\n\\nWill I return here? Yes absolutely. I had a lovely meal with my friend and I'm sure we shall return in due time. And I will come back with absolutely no qualms because this is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant and it falls far short of my finest Italian dining experiences but it's a good restaurant and sometimes good is good enough  (and cheap enough)."}

It seems obviously made for American taste buds. It wasn't very spicy. You can do that yourself I suppose. But still for the inducted, you also require a more robust base to start with. If you want a more authentic soup, it is not here. \\n\\nThey had a small menu. Sometimes that is a good thing, as it helps from choice overload. However, there were some other Vietnamese dishes, I would have liked to see.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and quick. Overall they did just fine. We may return in time to see how they grow."}

Two problems though...\\n\\nI just picked up my furchild from Camp Bow Wow, and it's sweltering hot outside. How am I going to go inside and pick up this food? Surely I am not aloud to bring her inside with me and surely I would never leave her in the car under the weather conditions. I sat in the parking lot contemplating  should I take her home and come all the way back or do I see if I can seek out a good citizen to watch my pup for a few min while I run inside and pay? NO! I can't do any of those things, am I crazy? No I'm not, just hungry. \\n\\nWhile sitting in the parking lot with my pup, I place a call to the restaurant. A super nice girl answers the phone, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could\\nShout her out! I explained my situation and ask if there is any way they can bring my food to the car? She said YES without hesitation. She even acknowledged my pup and said hello to her when she came out to the car. \\n\\nSo to end this long story I was super stoked that this location just continues to be so awesome and provided above and beyond service to me and my pup. PLUS...my order was RIGHT!!! SCORE!\\n\\nAdd on from a previous visit on different date: I order all our food, get to the counter to pay, and realize my wallet is missing. It's dinner time rush. So embarrassed and with people waiting behind me, I ask the cashier if there  is anyway I can call my bf and get his cc # to pay over the phone.

They have a sushi happy hour, and they have customer appreciation every Thursday.  Their sushi portions are almost excessive and I've never, ever had a bad meal there.  Denise goes out of her way to say hello to everyone,and the sushi chefs will call out their welcome as you walk through the door.\\n\\nIf you're looking for the typical shiney Scottsdale atmosphere, you've come to the wrong place.

{"label":4,"text":"Ok I've been eating Italian, real Italian, all my life with my friends and family through New York and New England and even in Italy and I am blown away by the authenticity and quality of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New Years Eve 2014. It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich\/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\\\"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar\/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.\\nI ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!\\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!\\nNeedless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. \\nThanks, Mama!"}
{"label":4,"text":"Great craft cocktails, featuring a lot of bourbon.  Drink service is medium-slow, but that's mostly because they spend a lot of time getting drinks right instead of slinging bad drinks quickly.\\n\\nThe door and windows are covered over; you have to look for it.  That has an enormous benefit; it's intentionally only visited by people who specifically went there, and the hordes of roving drunks in the Southside miss this place entirely.

More expensive, around $25 but it did have a neat-o volcano on the plate. So this meal was a little more pricey, around $35 with drinks, but still pretty reasonable.

I sat at the bar and was immediately assisted by Laura who remained friendly and helpful throughout my meal. I opted for the BBQ-style sandwich w\/ cole slaw and fresh fruit ( I'm afraid the good Dr. has advised me to reduce my intake of waffle fries...ugh.). The order arrived quickly and well presented, The bun, fruit and tasty pickle were all fresh. While the hefty sandwich was a bit difficult to eat without decorating my shirt, it was very tasty and hot. At about $18 including tip, my lunch was an excellent value.   \\n\\nUnion Grill has a good selection of beer (I'm not a big $10\/bottle wine guy), what appeared to be an efficient staff and a clean restroom. When combined with the tasty food and a location near the Carnegie Museums\/Carnegie Mellon and Pitt, it's a place I'm recommending to any of my friends who might find themselves in the neighborhood.

{"label":2,"text":"All pizzas are personal pizzas if you try hard and believe in yourself.  \\n\\nLocated at Stonecrest, at the end near City Tavern, in a spot that has been a couple of other pizza places, the interior of True Crafted is definitely an upgrade from the former tenants.  When you walk in, to your right you will order at the counter and get a number to put on your table for delivery.  They have booths, a long wooden family style table, chair seating and bar seating.  The pizza special for the day today was an 11\\\" white pizza with asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, ricotta, mozzarella and red pepper flakes.  I ordered the special without mushrooms with a Coke to drink (yay Coke products!) and it was just over $12.  \\n\\nI love, love, love white pizza.  This, I did not love.  I do not like for the ricotta to be in globs on the pizza, which this was.  It's a personal preference, and not a reflection of a bad tasting pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy without being hard.  The broccoli was cooked through as was the asparagus.  The red pepper flakes were a little heavy in some places on the pizza, but overall it was well balanced.  \\n\\nThe wait staff delivers your food and checks a few times to see if you need refills and see if everything is okay.  I found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  A couple of gentlemen, that I believe to be the owners and\/or the chef(s) after seeing their webpage, were walking around the restaurant checking on people as well.  I did like that the restaurant seemed to be kid\/family friendly without catering specifically to children, thus alienating those of us who don't want to listen to some guy making balloon animals while trying to eat.  \\n\\nThe execution of the pizza was fine, I just didn't particularly care for this pizza.  I will go again and try a regular cheese pizza and will update my review then."}

{"label":0,"text":"Bobby Flay,  you're a fraud.  Sorry man,  your TV shows are kinda cool, but after visiting your signature restaurant, I am not impressed at all.\\n\\nFirst of all, why does a master chef like yourself need to use so much damn salt?  It's cheating.  Salt does help bring out the flavor, but using too much of it is like how people use too much MSG on Chinese food and end  up making it all taste the same.\\n\\nI had the egg on a tortilla thing.  I don't even recall what it was called.  It was pretty darn salty, but edible.  The flavors weren't all that interesting.  Edible.  That's the best word to describe it.\\n\\nMy wife,  however, had the cobb salad.  The was so salty,  it was inedible.  So, she sent it back.  Asked them \\\"light salt\\\".  So, what did they do?  The still dusted the greens with salt.  Who puts salt on greens???\\n\\nThank God I never bought any of his cookbooks.  Apparently, the secret ingredient is half a shaker of salt.\\n\\nOh.  Sorry.  There was one plus.  I got to sit facing the sportsbook at Cesear's which everyone knows is the best sportsbook in town and got to watch the Michigan v. MSU football game.  Go Blue!"}

It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful."}
{"label":2,"text":"My sister always tells me, \\\"I had breakfast at Chompies.\\\" Being from California, I have no idea what Chompies is, so I decided to try this place out for dinner.  The table where we sat at was dirty. My brother-in-law had asked the bus boy to clean our table, in which he had a hard time scraping off what was on the table.  My sister took her baby wipes out and was able to get the crust off the table... Not to mention dirty menus. Cleanliness is important to me, so this brought this place a star down from what I would have originally rated it.  Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. His name is Dylan. He recommended the chicken schnitzel... SO GLAD I GOT IT! It was a chicken breast covered in a very thin crispy batter.  The chicken breast was very moist.  It came with my choice of two sides, in which I choose the broccoli and potato pancake. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and not over cooked at all. I can also tell the broccoli was fresh and not frozen broccoli that most restaurants serve. Potato pancake was perfectly crispy in the outside and soft in the inside. I had a huge serving, but was able to finish it. =) I posted my picture if you would like to see what I had. \\n\\nDylan definitely gets 5 stars for his excellent customer service.  Can't wait to try their breakfast next time."}
{"label":2,"text":"I have been to this location several times and it has been usually okay. \\n\\nThe service when they take my order has either been great or rude.  Sometimes, they are looking somewhere else or looking at people coming into the restaurant. This girl was not making any eye-contact with me and I can't even hear anything she is saying.  She seemed so distracted at everything else. \\n\\nThe food is usually served pretty quickly.  I always order the chipotle chicken and i always like it cause they taste the same every Panera location I go to.  My sister-in-law ordered one of the pastas and it tasted so horrible! The pasta was so chewy and it tasted like those middle-school lunches in the cafeteria.  It was just awful. \\nThe baguette is usually a miss for me. Sometimes its soft and taste like it just came out of the oven and most of the time it is hard and tasted old. Also, I ordered chicken caesar salad that was probably the only thing that tasted good and fresh. \\n\\nAnyways, panera has a variety of selections you can choose from and there is something for everyone.  This location is really big compared to other panera locations in las vegas."}
{"label":3,"text":"Vietnamese food made by (lovely!) Vietnamese family. They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.\\n\\nEstablished in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\\n\\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \\n\\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \\n\\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall."}

I'll stick to Rancho de Tia Rosa (which IS owned by the Sirrine's) next time.  \\n\\nThe service was PAINFULLY slow.   Now, I could understand that years ago when I used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table.  But when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there's NO EXCUSE for poor service.  \\n\\nThe salsas used to be SO MUCH BETTER and more flavorful.  They are a hint of their former selves.  The salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best... and that's a tremendous compliment.  Oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best I've ever, ever, ever had.  \\n\\nThe food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self.  It lacks the succulence, the flavor, and the wow-factor it had when Dennis Sirrine was calling the shots.  It's bland, slightly dry and just not there anymore.  What was equally disappointing is they've replaced their iced tea (something used to drive across town for) to a horrible concentrate.  Blech.  \\n\\nConsidering this place used to be packed to the gills on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on Friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables, the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  They absolutely cannot go on like this."}

Sometimes a wait, maybe 10 minutes at worst. \\n\\nAlways cute women servers, but service sometimes spotty. I hate that I ask for a minute or two to look at the menu, and then have to wait 10 minutes to order. I wouldn't care if they got rid of female only servers, as long as they were attentive. \\n\\nThey usually have a good weekly special for $8 or so, with drink.

The server took the courtesy (ha!) to flatten the gelato so I only got the same volume as the cup. I've had gelati in Roma and for that price I'd have gotten 3 big cones worth. \\n\\nI wouldn't have been so mad if it was good gelato - but of course, it was very, very ordinary.

We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.\\n\\nThings started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. \\n\\nFirst it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, \\\"oh yeah.\\\"  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. \\n\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner.

Our service was poor, uninformed and slow to the point of feeling ignored. Our server could not explain the signature cocktail saying \\\"I think it has gin in it\\\" The food was just fair and in fact, the frites were served cold and limp. We were asked upon making the reservation if this was a special occasion. We said yes, it was my birthday. Our server did acknowledge my birthday but never offered dessert to our table. No one stopped by the table at any time to ask how our meal was and frankly, it's a good thing or I would have let them have it. I would say it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Don't waste your time or your money on this place."}

I tried from my computer writing a new e-mail (since the other one was erased), but that one wouldn't submit either. Then I sent a 1 word e-mail. Hey! That went through!

The people who work here seem to really like their job and I like the usher that tells jokes while we're waiting for the previews. Ticket prices are the same if not lower than others. I took my kids here and they were in love. Now when I'm sitting at another movie theater, I just wish I could be reclining instead. I am definitely a fan, even after I let them eat up $30 for Ironman 3D on top of my other Ironman movie tickets (I paid a total of $54 to watch Ironman 3. It wasn't worth it). Come!

The prices continue on this level and you start to realise that these are prices of a local charity shop in a small town, yet the charity shop is in the middle of the city.  The result of all this is that you get a fantastic amount of bargains.\\n\\nYou may think I'm exaggerating, but let me tell you a story of the best deal I've ever had in a charity shop.  One day I walk in and there's two books (Agatha Christie's if you are interested) for 50p each; not a bad deal I thought so I bought them both.  Then a week later I'm back in and now they have more of these books, but now at 30p so I ended up buying 5 more - 5 books for \\u00a31.50.  For some of the more expensive charity book shops you can't even buy one book for \\u00a31.50, this really is a great value for money shop."}

{"label":2,"text":"I'm still on the fence about this place, but here are some observations:\\n\\nFranktuary is generally vegan friendly, but the menu lacks informative labeling (as some meat eaters have also pointed out). \\n\\nThe veggie dogs are the same boring dogs you can get anywhere, but the different executions make them slightly more interesting. I haven't tried the veggie sausage, I think it might have egg in it (example of how a menu indication could be useful). \\n\\nBeet balls = yum! \\n\\nGarbanzo fries, also a hit! \\n\\nSome of the cocktails are way overpriced. The \\\"Refugio\\\" is a nice enough mezcal drink, but it's $14 and not up to par with Salt or Cantina's less pricey concoctions. It was not particularly strong, like a mezcal drink should be; it was rather on the sweet side and was lacking the bitter and sour elements of the grapefruit ingredient. Plus, it is served in a coupe with a plastic straw, which seems tacky and pointless (the straw). I had another even less impressive drink there on my first visit, which I cannot remember...The bartender seems sincere in his efforts, so I hope he can fine tune things a bit, and get the prices in line."}

Tony, the manager, walked up and was gracious and understanding of the situation...he gaves us menus and told us what he liked the best. I wasn't that hungry so I opted for a heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad...my friend got a bone-in Ribeye, truffle mac n' cheese...and also bananas foster for dessert.

They have good servers there, just not enough of them. I kept noticing both times how my server was working just about every table I could see. \\nAs for the cost, dinner for 2 plus tip, was about $30.

How could they actually give you a shrimp cocktail for $1?  Too good to be true?\\nIndeed... It's two spoons of micro shrimp over cocktail sauce over shredded celery. Tasty snacking, but not the same as up the street... and the loose celery in your system will come back to haunt you, I found out later.\\n\\nI also ordered a saimin, to compare to the grill in the Plaza up the street, and immediately regretted it when I saw them unwrap it and jam it in the microwave.  All in all, the eatery is meh.  Perhaps they're open crazy hours and they might be a godsend if you're drunk or stoned at 4AM with the munchies, but during normal business hours, you definitely get what you pay for... or sometimes even a little less.

{"label":3,"text":"I'm willing to bet that this place was a shining gem in its heyday.  Several days have passed since that day...leaving the same gem, minus a lot of the luster.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is quite spacious. It has a full bar to the left, a large recessed dining area in the middle (geared more towards groups), and a more secluded are to the right for smaller groups and\/or couples. All three sections are quite spacious. \\n\\nWe happened to sit off to the right. We had a party of four and half (one three-year-old). The tables in this section were for a maximum of four people, and our daughter is FAR to tall for a high chair. Thankfully for us, where there are some bay windows facing out of the restaurant, there is a nice little padded booth created there, which turned out to be the PERFECT place for our daughter!\\n\\nThe menu for Serrano's is typical, but it's pretty limited. They offer the usual Mexican fare, usually in both chicken and beef (and ONE that offered shrimp). Both the quality and quantity of each dish we ordered was substantial. Suffice it to say that each member of our party left the restaurant with a take-home box.\\n\\nOur server was stellar. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so if he HAD been lacking, it would have made things very awkward. But, as it happened, Christian was phenomenal! He was patient with us while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive. He was very diligent with keeping our drinks full and our table cleared.\\n\\nBut, the coolest thing Christian did for us was regarding dessert. You see, it was my wife's birthday, and her parents wanted to go to this restaurant for a celebratory dinner. My wife was deathly afraid that the restaurant employees were going to make her wear a sombrero and sing a song to her...and Christian almost made that happen. However, when he could see the sheer terror behind my wife's eyes at the prospect of public humiliation, he took the clue, and offered to comp her dessert. \\n\\nThis shopping center that houses this restaurant is practically empty. There are \\\"For Lease\\\" signs in several of the windows. I can see why this place has stood the test of time...though, I feel that their menu could use a little updating, which is the only reason I opted for four stars instead of five for this cozy little relic."}

The steak... wow. Well, this place IS called a steakhouse for a reason.\\nI had the 9 ounce fillet, medium (I know, how boring... but I wasn't super hungry and my significant other didn't want to share the chateaubriand).\\nIt was perfectly seared, the perfect color of red\/pink in the middle, tasted heavenly and once the plate was empty, not a single drop of blood to be found.

{"label":3,"text":"I've attended the AZ Renaissance Festival for over 15 years now and love it!\\n\\nFrom the moment that you approach the front gates and are greeted\/heckled by the crowd of townspeople, you're transported back to a fantasy version of the middle ages. Whether you choose to dress up in period-appropriate attire or show up in your 21st century duds, you'll feel right at home amidst the quaint shops, cottages, and stands that make up the milieu of the Arizona Renaissance Festival. \\n\\nWhen we start early (a good idea if you'd like to avoid the hottest part of the day and the longest lines\/biggest crowds) my favoritest way to begin the day is with pastries or the freshly made crepes. There are several very munchable snacks that are perfect for enjoying as you stroll: cinnamon roasted almonds, freshly made pretzels (sold from a large rack carried over a gentleman's shoulder as he wanders the crowd), heck, even the famous (and delicious!) Turkey Leg is very portable. The Turkey Leg, complete with crispy skin, is delicious but the portion is HUGE, I can rarely come even close to finishing. Additional substantial meal-fare items are the bread bowls (my husband's favorite) and Steak on a Stake - all yummy! \\n\\nIf you've ever wanted to try your hand at throwing knives, axes, or tomatoes, this is the place for you! There are lots of different games (which have an additional cost) and rides to pass the time and keep the kiddos busy - a huge swan-swing, pirate ships, spinning butterfly swings are all fanciful options to choose from.\\n\\nWe always try to make the most out of the free entertainment offered and start our day by plotting out the shows that we'd like to see - our favorites are Barely Balanced (acrobats that are talented and are also hilarious), Thom Sellectomy the Sword Swallower (gross but impressive), Falconry, where they show off lots of beautiful rescued birds over an open green belt (it is educational and interesting!) and of course Jousting. The Jousting is a little cheesy, but we typically try to catch the last show: The Joust to the Death, which is the best one.\\n\\nIt is easy to fill the gaps between the shows, games, and meals by wandering through the shops and browsing their wares; they have lots of unique items from renaissanc-y clothing to weapons and jewelry to wooden toys to furniture. \\n\\nThe petting zoo - complete with ducks, bunnies, sheep dogs, pigs, goats, and a highland cow(!) - as well as the Greyhound Rescue pavilion with their sweet pups are always obligatory stops to get in our warm fuzzies :)\\n\\nTips: Be sure to bring cash, as many of the food vendors don't accept credit cards. Also, if you plan on attending the shows, set aside cash to give after the performance - they are free, but the performers live off of the tips and they do a great job, so it is good to have cash handy if you feel so inclined. There are ATMs in the faire, but the fees that they charge get expensive.\\n\\nTraffic on the 60 headed out to the festival gets really, really bad. Mid-day on a busy weekend can turn what might normally be a 40 minute drive into 1.5-2 hours, so be prepared. \\n\\nParking is well done - they've taken a page from the Disney parks and have a bunch of people there to direct all of the cars into specific spaces in a very quick and efficient manner. \\n\\nThe parking lot and grounds are all in a dusty dirt field, so plan accordingly with what you wear. If it is rainy, that all turns to mud and it is a MESS! \\n\\nBathrooms throughout the whole festival are clean and modern... there is a restroom outside the entry that typically has long lines, but the lines for the restrooms inside tend to be much shorter. \\n\\nIf you're looking for something unique and fun that will transport you to another time and place, definitely make the trek to the Arizona Renaissance Festival; its a blast!"}

Coming from Texas, they are similar to which-wich or potbelly's, but with less options.\\n\\nI went with the club sandwich which consisted of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  The sandwich was bland and did not have much flavor.  I didn't even notice that there was bacon in my sandwich. \\n\\nI guess I have just been spoiled by similar businesses that are located in other states.  The big advantage of this place is that it is located in an excellent location on the strip, is open 24 hours a day, and the prices are reasonable considering where it is located."}

I ordered from the $59 prix fixe menu, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert - all in all, a good value!   \\n\\nI enjoyed the onion soup, served with shaved truffles and duck.  It was rich and earthy with an unexpected presentation.  Next I had gently heated salmon with juilinee vegetables and a green horseradish sauce.  My salmon was perfectly cooked and the dish looked beautiful, but the sauce, frankly tasted like grass clippings!  Bitter and overpowering.  My friend seemed to enjoy her stout braised short ribs.  The dessert, a \\\"trio of chocolates\\\", was a miss: a dry souffle, a salty peanutbutter shake and Baily's ice cream.  None of the desserts really did it for me.  \\n\\nI may have expected too much from this place, but hey, it's Hu bert Keller's spot!  Who knows, maybe I caught them on a bad night.  I'd like to return some time and give the regular menu a chance, but with so many INCREDIBLE places to eat in Vegas I can't make any guarantees.\\n\\nPROS: Great service, Great wine and Reasonable prixe fixe menus. \\nCONS: Too many 'miss' dishes for a 4 star"}

{"label":1,"text":"I heard great things about this place and really wanted to like it, but it disappointed me, both in food and service.\\n\\nThe location didn't bother me as it seemed to bother other reviewers. You have to pay for parking which is inconvenient if you don't have change, but I was willing to do that if the food was good. Sadly, it wasn't.\\n\\nFirst of all our server was very aggressive. He put his hand on the back of my chair and leaned in close to my personal space. He creeped me out. I appreciate friendliness but I don't appreciate you getting really close to me. My husband noticed it right away too.\\n\\nWe had coffee while waiting for our order. It wasn't horrible or anything- I've had much worse- but it tasted over extracted, like they were skimping on the amount of coffee used to brew it. At $3 a cup (yep, $6 in total for two mugs of coffee), it should taste better than that.\\n\\nMy husband ordered shrimp & grits and he loved it. He ordered it because that's the dish he heard others raving about.\\n\\nI ordered the eggs benedict and holy moly, the sauce was SOUR! Not a good kind of sour either. The bacon was also limp and chewy. Yes, it was turkey bacon, which I eat at home all the time, but it didn't even taste like it was cooked. It was really gross.\\n\\nThe serving size was small, but that wouldn't have bothered me if the food actually tasted good. I don't like stuffing myself with huge portions at breakfast, but it's hard to not feel ripped off when you paid $13 for english muffins with limp bacon and sour hollandaise sauce.\\n\\nThe ambience was cool and hipster-ish. I think it's cool that they let their waiters have tattoos and dyed hair, but that doesn't make the food taste better or the waiter less creepy. Also the music was far too loud, my husband and I could barely have a conversation.\\n\\nFinal verdict: waste of money for now. The place is new, maybe they'll work the kinks out. If they changed a few things this place could be great but I'm not returning for now."}

It was definitely a good size to fill you up.  The crepe wasn't horrible just a bit off than what I would normally taste from other crepe places.  The dough was just really off and threw the rest if the taste off.  I wouldn't come back unless they changed their crepe batter."}

From what I understand they have happy hour from open - 5pm and 8pm-close. ONLY GO DURING THESE TIMES or you will be overpaying for ok sushi. I was happy with the beer and sake selection but this was probably the most impressive part of my visit.

I was placed on hold, and my bank replied that there are no problems with my card. It took forever for us to leave this place. FOREVER, as in 45 minutes, I ve had wine, a good meal, Im ready to gamble and I felt like I was taken hostage in this nice restaurant. Im sorry, but at one point, you gotta give up, the customer comes first. Finally, I was told by the manager that the card went through but that they wont be able to issue a receipt that I could sign, so I felt kinda bad thinking, does that mean no tip for my waiter ? I told the manager that I had no cash and wanted to give a tip to the waiter , manager said not  to worry. I am pretty sure my waiter never got a tip.

The room worked well for us.  I personally was not a fan of the large planes flying over us while in the pool and they did keep me awake the first night.  But my son loved them, he watched them out of our window while in our room and playing out in the pool.  The housekeeping and kitchen staff were very friendly and very helpful.

{"label":2,"text":"Whole Foods was easy to find - if you are somewhat familiar with the area you will have no trouble locating it.  While parking on a Thursday evening was no issue, I can see that this place would be unbearable on the weekend.  The surface lot stayed full the entire time I was there, and while there is underground parking, there aren't a LOT of spaces.  The underground lot is very well lit with several emergency phones.  The parking spaces are a good size, so folks aren't dinging doors.\\n\\nThe store itself is well designed and utilizes every inch of space for either products or seating.  I was impressed by the size, cleanliness and organization of the store.  I briefly walked up and down a few aisles and did see that the prices on items that I get from HT (namely the Amy's organic brand) were either the same or slightly higher than HT.  There were a lot of choices for gluten-free products.  I don't know that I would say WF is overpriced, as I believe that quality items are worth a little more (if indeed they are of a higher quality to justify the higher cost), but the prices for the products that they do carry do seem to be higher than HT on comparable items.\\n\\nThe staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Whenever I asked questions of the staff, they were quick with a smile and some friendly assistance.  Good customer service goes a long way!  \\n\\nThe prepared foods section is VAST.  There is a refrigerated section with foods portioned and ready to go (salads, wraps, soups, quiche) and there are also several food bars with salads, hot items and soups.  The dessert bar was beautiful (cupcakes, cakes, cookies, pies).  Nearby there was a large selection of sushi.  A deli section with noodles, prepared salads, veggies.  A gelato bar that looked incredible.  Pizza by the slice or entire pie (they also had take-and-bake pizzas in the refrigerated section).  And I believe there was a blended beverage bar as well. \\n\\nThe salad bar had standard fare with a few upgrades.  The salad is $7.99\/lb. and salad is surprisingly heavy.  For a small salad with a drizzle of dressing, plus a spoonful of potato salad, I paid almost $9.   A small cup of Smoky Bacon Tomato soup ($2.49) that was delicious.  I could not resist some sweets and got a piece of strawberry cake for $4.49.  YUMMY!  Soup and dessert were winners, salad was nothing special.  Thumbs up for the green packaging products\/utensils and very well labeled recycling centers.  \\n\\nOn the 2nd floor, there is more indoor seating as well as a very large outdoor patio with tables and cushy chairs. The 3rd floor contained another few tables and the classroom.  The classroom overall appeared very nice - pleasing colors, clean, shiny.  There are several cameras pointed at the cooking area and 2 flat-screen TV's for viewing what is going on.  \\n\\nI attended the Cheese Board class ($25).  We were each given a plate with slices of different kinds of cheese, plus a small plate with fruit spreads, pesto, and honey, along with a piece of paper with the names of the cheeses and room for notes.  The two instructors did a pretty good job explaining the different kinds of cheese, how they're made, etc.  I am guessing I don't have the refined palate needed to appreciate what was served.  The tastes for me ranged anywhere from 'meh, that's okay' to 'this tastes like soap'.  The others in the class seemed to enjoy them all, so I believe my lack of enthusiasm is just an indicator of my Kraft taste buds and not the quality of the cheeses.  Wine and beer was poured to test how the cheeses could be paired.  The fig and tart cherry spreads served were out of this world .  At the end you get to try the cheeses again, with different pairings, and ask questions.  Informative class, good instructors, I give the class-experience itself a solid B.\\n\\nMy MAIN problem, which will keep me from signing up for actual cooking classes (which are $50+ per class) is the chairs are too damn close together.  You had best go with someone you love because you are going to be sandwiched right on top of them.  The chairs literally touch one another.  The woman sitting next to me pushed her hair behind her ear and her hair brushed my shoulder.  True story.  Unless you are buying me dinner and going home with me afterwards, you shouldn't be sitting that close to me.  If the seating area was more comfortable, I would go to several of the classes a month, but my anxiety over sharing oxygen with a stranger in such close proximity will cause me to look elsewhere for cooking classes.  \\n\\nWhole Foods was a neat experience... if I was a woman of leisure with money to burn, I could definitely fall in love with it.  But since I am a full-time working girl who has to keep the lights on, I will save Whole Foods as a once-in-a-while splurge and stick to hometown Harris Teeter for my day-to-day grocery needs."}

After sitting there 3 hours, I decided to order a Chai iced latte and lemon poppy muffin. The latte is pretty good, but didn't stand out to me as a MUST have in my drink list.\\n\\nI will definitely go back for the extremely friendly staff, and to try the cuban coffee in a colder weather."}

The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy.\\nWelllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn't explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is \\\"helping\\\" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks \\\"Did you order it with your server?\\\"....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn't even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I'd rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it."}
{"label":2,"text":"Rating the way the hotel rooms look, and solely just look, I give this place about 4 - 4.5 stars. I like the decor and everything, definitely one of my top 3 favorites, after vdara and palazzo. \\n\\nBut regarding the hotel as a whole, 3 stars is more justifiable. First off, the location sucks. Why oh why does it have to be so far away from the strip? And second, the reception here is HORRIBLE (regarding the hotel rooms, not the lobby and general casino area). I've been to two rooms, floors 2 and 6, and none of them have service. If anything, you can get service for about 5 minutes and then POOF its gone. It's very irritating. And there's also no free wifi, $12.99 for 24 hours per device. Free wifi in the lobby supposedly though, but I couldn't seem to find a decent connection.\\n\\nAnd the bathrooms in the rooms look really nice, but the doors? Oh my effing piece of crap they are the most annoying doors I have ever came into contact with. They look nice, don't get me wrong. I looked at them and was like wow how modern and stylish and stuff...but there is no way to close them without making the HUGEST sound. They just slam by themselves unless you grab them and slowly close them each time. Trust me, if you stay here, you'll know what I'm talking about. \\n\\nAs for the rest of the hotel, of course as everyone knows, their buffet is very popular. I like how they also have hash house a go go here as well. And their bakery babycakes is pretty good too. \\n\\nA major plus is the pool area. Pretty fun and interesting. One of my favorite pools in vegas (I think monte carlo has the best though). Its two split pools with lounge chairs in the middle and spread around. The music they play is upbeat and gets you dancing in a fun way. The house\/pop music is played in the 21+ pool to the side. That area was alright, a lesser version of tao beach in my opinion. I'd rather go swimming in the main pool.  \\n\\nThe gym is pretty nice, better than some of the other hotel gyms in vegas. BUT its $15.99 per hotel guest, which is annoying because usually gym memberships are free with being a guest. And it's not nice enough to pay $15.99.\\n\\nSo three stars because even though this place definitely has its ups, I'm very annoyed with how much they charge for things that should be free. The location is a hassle. And they need to do something about cell phone reception because I use my phone a lot."}

The food here was very inexpensive, with not many dishes over 6$. As expected, the food isn't anything special. I had the eggs benedict special and it was fine... not something I would run back for, but fine. The hollandaise didn't taste like it was freshly made (maybe the stuff from the jar... eek... maybe just a somewhat poorly made hollandaise... either way, not great). The benedict also had some spinach on it that they had absolutely cooked to death, but the eggs were cooked correctly. The potatoes on the side were very plain.

{"label":0,"text":"I usually don't write reviews for huge chains like this, but sometimes you just gotta vent.  Hit the drive-thru on Black Friday with the wife.  I ordered a Venti (large) caramel brulee latte, while she got a Tall (small) Pep Mocha latte.  The total was approximately $8.  I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.  Her rational to me was that 'it wasn't that big of a difference because both drinks are about $4'.  I questioned her, specifically asking her if venti and tall drinks really cost the same.  She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.  If I had not said anything, I could understand, but I questioned which drink she took off and she either lied to me, or was too incompetent to know the price difference.  Additionally, annoying is that I promptly sent an email to Starbucks customer service and a full week later, I have not received a response.

They are more pricey than I would like to see, but the facility (in a large business park warehouse) was large and was comparable to Pet Smart's hotel.  You make up the price difference when you consider that the dogs are constantly socializing and playing with each other for most of the day.  You don't have to pay extra for the socialization and it gets your dog out of its pen.\\n\\nFor my small dog, I did have a small pen, which had its own cot.  There are tvs scattered around showing dog related cartoons and programming.  There are small, medium, and large sized play areas, depending on your size dog.

For those who arent aware, a liege waffle is different and much better than a normal waffle. These belgian style waffles are filled with pearl sugar that caramelizes when cooked. Theyre more like desserts than breakfast dishes. My favorite crepe is the fresh fruit medley which is filled with strawberries, bananas, and honeydews then topped with a dulce de leche sauce. The menu description says that is also includes kiwis but I have never seen a kiwi in this crepe and Ive ordered it several times-I wish theyd actually start putting them in. One of my only complaints about Crispy Crepe is that their menu descriptions are also inaccurate. The bananofie crepe is good but I was a little peeved about the misleading menu description. This crepe is supposed to be filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard. I love custards so I was a bit dismayed when my crepe arrived and was topped with a butterscotch sauce instead of a custard-not the same thing! It was still very tasty but I think it would be even better with a real custard. Ive never had a chance to order the coffee drinks because its hard for me to drink a sugary drink while also eating a sweet dish but one day, Ill have to come in to get coffee and nothing else. The butter cookie latte sounds intriguing. Overall, very good but beware of the fact that what you order may not match the description exactly!"}
{"label":0,"text":"I am local and decided to spend NYE at the Rivera to see a concert. Big mistake. I purposefully hand picked two front row seats at $100 each and had the floor plan in front of me when I purchased them. I know NYE is big in town so I purchased tickets months in advance. There were 3 sections near the stage and I choose front row section 2 - dead center.  \\n\\nThe night of the show, I discovered the floor plan had changed. The three front sections had changed to six sections. Section 2 was up against the far wall of the auditorium. The two front row seats I chose were now moved way off to the side. I had a side view of huge speakers and literally could not see the stage at all from my seat.\\n\\nThe two other couples who sat next to me all agreed this was not the floor plan we choose seats for. All though we didn't know each other, all six of us went to talk to the box office manager together.   \\nThe response to our concerned but polite inquiry? Too bad.\\n\\nAll 6 of us were shocked how callous the box office staff treated us. No apologies and no offers to move us. They told us floor moves happen all the time and we bought our tickets too far in advance and we should have waited. This made no sense to me at all. I planned this night well in advance and I am suffering the consequences for my careful planning? All of us agreed our NYE was ruined. \\nI wrote a nice letter to the Director or Entertainment explaining the situation and I never heard a word back.\\nWith all the hotels in town, it is no surprise the Rivera is probably last in terms of reputation and image and they well deserve to be. Never again."}
{"label":3,"text":"I really liked staying at this hotel. We had an excellent room. It is very classy and chill compared to the other Vegas casinos. Clean, quiet, modern - like a boutique hotel on steroids. I would prefer to be even more central on the Strip (e.g. Caesar's). Late night we spent too much time at the Luxor - b\/c that was our only walkable choice (other than Excaliber)."}

{"label":1,"text":"Went there with a buddy to use a groupon I had purchased based on previous reviews.  Easy to find, but not a lot of parking.  Inside was okay, fairly typical BBQ style setup.  The cashier must have seen me looking at my phone, based on the the semi snide groupon remark....I ordered the pulled pork with two sides and a drink, my friend had the chicken with two sides and a drink.  All together we paid $27 or so, which was wayyyyy too much, considering the little amount of food we received.  It was okay, nothing to write home about; the portion to price ratio is what left a sour taste.  Don't know if that's because we didn't pay full price there, but that's their business decision.  I won't be going there again, not even with a 50% off groupon."}
{"label":1,"text":"Good service, pretty quick - but a total ripoff if you're looking for anything but a top - to - tails oil, fluid, filter change and detail experience. I'm a do-it-yerselfer on a lot of car stuff, so I wanted to come here for a simple oil change, and was told that that was not an option. I ended up spending 90 bucks for the whole shebang, and although the car looked great when they were finished (had an hour to wait that day, but Pappa's was withing walking distance, win!!) the fact that I wasn't given more options as to the level of service I required pissed me off."}

{"label":3,"text":"I have been reading a lot of the other reviews for this place stating that the Red Velvet Cake\/Cupcake, upon which this cafe bases its name, is a 150 calorie treat.  Ok, either that is a lie, or I have been WASTING MY LIFE by not going there EVERY DAY.  Because those cakes are fucking delicious, and with the approximate calorie count as a a can of soda? I would gladly drink water henceforth and have dessert.  I will be going there tomorrow.  \\n\\nOk, real review.  Generally great food.  I've had really good luck with everything I've ordered there. Except for maybe the fries.  They're not so hot.  \\n\\nFirst, everything on the menu can be made veggie\/vegan, but usually at an extra charge. I'm fine with that, but it can add up if you're ordering for a lot of people I guess.  My favorite thing by far (and something that I get an insatiable craving for from time to time) is the vegan buffalo chicken wrap.  It's full of spicy and crunchy and protein-y goodness, all wrapped up in a toasted tortilla.  I also love their fruit lemonades!  I've never had a dessert I didn't like, but the red velvet is my fave.  Did I mention that I'm going there tomorrow to get one? I might just have to pick up a vegan buffalo chicken wrap to go with it.....\\n\\nWarning: the service is SLOOOOOOOOOW.  Even if you're the only table there.  The owners\/managers\/servers have always been super friendly to me and very nice and accommodating.  But expect to wait awhile, even if you call in a to-go order.  Also, it's not clear whether they sometimes do table service now (maybe at night?).  Your best bet is to go order at the counter (that's what I always do -- if they're doing table service they will let you know).  But otherwise -- yay!"}
{"label":3,"text":"I don't know what I can say that others have not already said about this establishment.  When first arriving, it is in a strip mall, tucked off the strip.  The complete opposite of the glitz of Vegas.  The decor inside is simple and the restaurant is clean.  There is lovely peaceful music to be heard.  One will seat themselves and the proprietor will come over with the menu and make some nice suggestions.\\n\\nBeing vegan and never having Ethiopian food before, I was glad to have my companions with me to make suggestions.  Apparently, this establishments specialty is the vegetarian dish so we knew we were in for a treat.\\n\\nStarting off with lentil sambusas, I had wished I had ordered more.  My companions stated they were the best they had ever eaten.  The dough was flaky, tender,  the sauce was flavorful and the filling was simple and delicious.\\n\\nThe vegetarian platter we ordered was literally enough for two to three people.  It has an array of lentils, vegetables, salads, and is served with injera.  You eat with your hands here.  The display of this dish is beautiful and I immediately had to take a picture, it is a work of art.\\n\\nMy friends ordered the Ethiopian coffee service.  The gentleman told us that the lady who performed the service was off that day.  We were surprised to find that she did come in on her day off to perform the service for us.  Wow is all I can say.  Please do not leave without having the coffee service, it is an experience and is delicious.\\n\\nThe value of the food you receive here will surprise you.  We had dinner for six people, including appetizers and the coffee ceremony.  $58 before the tip.\\n\\nif you want a break from the fast pace of Vegas, do yourself a favor and head over to Meskerem."}
{"label":0,"text":"I'm not one to judge pub food, because I don't eat it often. However, I am more than displeased with the food I ate at Burgundy Lion. I lie crouched in my bed right now suffering from a stomach ache, which was not there before I ate at B.L. It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint. Overall, this place is overrated and overpriced! Go at your own risk!"}

{"label":2,"text":"OK, so hear it goes.  Rudy's is new in the West Valley (I-10 & Litchfield Rd.)  I have had friends tell me about it so I wanted to try it.  The place was pretty packed, it was a short wait in a good sized line to get to the food counter.  Once there they will ask you if you have been there before.  If not, they will offer you tastings of the meats and explain the serving to you. There may be several new comers so you will have to deal will people who want to try everything because they don't know what they want. That is irritating but expected.  As it was our first time at Rudy's we wanted to try several items.  We ordered Cutter's Brisket, Turkey, regular Sausage, Rudy's pinto beans, green chili, potato salad, coleslaw & a micro brew bottle beer. They have plenty of beer and beverage choices. Everything was good but the stand out for me was the Turkey.  Get the Turkey! it had excellent flavor and smokiness while remaining moist and tender.  The brisket was dry and not as flavorful. The beans were good but not great. I like great beans. the Coleslaw was very good. The potato salad was my least favorite.  The sausage was huge and it had great flavor.  They offer their brand of BBQ sauce in Sissy or Original (a bit more spicy).  I compare this place to Texas BBQ House, where the brisket is much more flavorful and moist. They do not offer Turkey however. I also like the flavor and consistency of Texas BBQ House's BBQ sauce much better.  Rudy's was good, not a negative experience, I just had higher hopes for a full flavor of brisket I get elsewhere. I prefer Texas BBQ House over Rudy's.  Give Rudy's a try and see what you think."}
{"label":3,"text":"A lot of their other dishes, particularly the curries, range from good to great.  Their Tom Yum Kung soup with tofu, on the other hand, is sublime.  It is truly exceptional...the kind of thing you want to bathe in...the kind of thing that compels you to write your first Yelp review.  Full disclaimer -- I haven't ordered it with the shrimp the dish calls for because I live in fear of imported farm raised shrimp (you should too).  I am not sure if they use farmed shrimp, but I don't need to find out because the tofu is perfect.  Lao Laan-Xang, I'll be thinking of you."}

The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus. On another occasion we bought some solidified pickle.

Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).

The only downside to my dinner visit was that I was already sort of full from a late lunch, which meant I couldn't fit much into my belly :( Sad, I know.\\n\\nSo my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.\\n\\nDessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed.

The room we reserved was sold out so we were downgraded\\n3. Customer service was a little suspect; none of the employees went out of thier way to smile or be helpful \\n4. The view of City Center from our room.  Yuck!!\\n5. The room in the spa tower had two beds and one chair.  Only one of us could sit and watch the lake show at a time comfortably.  Seriously, could they not have put a second chair in the room?\\n6. The toilet faces the shower and there isn't that much space between the two. This seemed like a bad layout.\\n7. They piled the pillows in shams and the duvets that they (probably) use on the beds in the room.  (This is where the extra chairs should have been.) They never actually made the bed with these items durring our stay.  \\n8. Television was small, had bad sound and was dated - 27 inch rear projection.  \\n\\nOverall, I don't think we would pay to stay in this hotel because we always felt that we were an after thought. We stayed at GVR and Palazzo during this trip and thought that there rooms were much nicer in those two hotels and we were treated much more kindly at both of those hotels."}

Okay, the place is entitled to close between meals - though surprising as they are the only restaurant at the Ritz Carlton.   \\n\\nThat evening we had a party of 8 dining and I requested my Dover sole be made without butter and with olive oil instead.

Being new to the area, we have tried other Thai places and have been very disappointed.  That being said, this place was awesome!  We had the appetizer sampler, chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup with meatballs and sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert.  The sampler came with spring rolls, two types of rangoons, shrimp and veggie tempura.  They were all very good.  I normally do not like rangoons but I was fighting my hubby for these.  My husband loved his pad thai.  He got the spice level 7 and said it was perfect.  My soup was very good.  The sweet sticky rice made my eyes roll back in my head.  The service was prompt and very friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  The prices were very good.  (pad thai was 8.95 and soup was 9.95) we didn't finish them because the portions were huge so definitely worth the money.  We are so pleased we stumbled across this little gem.

Practically everything at Panda is dipped in some cornstarch concoction and fried. That leaves for a large volume of your meat being starch. This place is awesome, because they don't do that crap. The mongolian beef is all beef and plenty of vegetables. The mandarin chicken is less fatty than Panda, at Panda the chicken is fairly fatty. Anyways, I like this place a lot for the reasons I've already listed. The taste doesn't overwhelm you like it does at Panda. Yeah, Panda is good the first three times you try it, after that its rather bland and maybe even gross. \\n\\nService here was excellent. Came in, got a smile, got my food, they were willing to do half chow mein, half rice. Awesome. Pricing is good, thus, value is good.

After about 15 mins we did ask a busperson to ask our waitperson to stop by.  After another 15 minutes with no contact and repeatedly seeing who appeared to be the manager and other waitstaff walk by and making eye contact with us and gestures by us for assistance, still no service or even a \\\"hello, I'll be right with you.\\\"  So we got up, gathered our coats, and quietly left.  Maybe because we left quietly, no one raised an eyebrow on our way out or said goodbye.  In all fairness, I think this is unusual for a Food Fight restaurant and I tend to doubt that this is a pattern.  We may try it again but there are so many other options in the area on how to spend our dining dollars, we are likely to give other places a chance before going back to Craftsman and giving them another."}

We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \\\"jelly\\\" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.  We both left feeling fulfilled, but not stuffed which was nice. \\nThe experience at Table 274 was a great start to our night and we'll definitely be returning soon.  Great job Table 274!"}

From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\\n\\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1\/2 glasses extra. Bonus!\\n\\nSomeday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"}

Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it. \\n\\nThe bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said \\\"oh well.\\\"  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?\\n\\nThe bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend. \\n\\nThe picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.  \\n\\nIn summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu."}

However, there is a lack of service here that needs to be pointed out. After our first night., housekeeping came in the middle of us having breakfast. I told them to come back in about an hour and we should be done. We got dressed and before we left the hotel, I called to request the room be serviced. When we came back, it was not serviced at all. All our dirty dishes and such were still hangin around. No towels refreshed. The next morning, we had to clean our own dishes before leaving. They have huge heavy doors at the main entrance and NO doorman helping open doors for women, elderly, or anything. People are forced to haul open these huge doors while carrying their luggage and such. Amenities and hotel comfort gets a 3 star review, but service lacks and loses two stars for it."}

Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.\\n\\nb.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.\\n\\nc.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.

Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.\\n\\ne.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great.

I was also expecting more of a selection, but the menu is only about 20 items. As well, I like draft beer, but there were only four options as well -- a little of a disappointment.  Anyways, I ordered a chicken panini sandwich with fries, and the portion I was served was a decent amount (more than I was expecting after reading the reviews).  Our waiter was very courteous and patient with us trying to talk to one another and yet figure out what we wanted.

Off the menu the standouts for me were the Lobster Brioche, apple cinnamon pancakes, pork ribs and the junk food dessert platter.  Honestly, I thought the food was all amazing.\\n\\nNow, the service on the other hand was a major fail!  I'm paying for bottomless drinks and I shouldn't have to wave or hunt down staff for this.  Even ordering our first items off the menu upon arrival took quite a while.  Keep in mind we joined a large ongoing birthday party in the back dining area.  At one point someone in our party took it upon themselves to retrieve the champagne and serve us.  \\n\\nJust like my prior visit for dinner, Simon did come out which is a nice touch.

I didn't wait very long before she started on my pedicure and she listened to what I wanted (just filing my nails - no clipping.)  The massage chairs work on the bottom and back; there's a lot going on there if you want it, or you can adjust using the controls.  She did a fine job on my toes.  \\n   My major complaint comes as we moved over to the manicure.  The tables were gross!!  I wanted to ask for a sponge and some lysol to start cleaning myself.  The manicure tables were dirty and small.  Another customer commented on the cramped space and someone mentioned that they would be getting new tables soon.  I can only hope that someone might be bothered to keep the layer of grime off the new ones, but I doubt it. \\n   Grand total for the experience was $55 for the mani-pedi.  It was passable, but they could be doing a lot better.  Improve the customer interaction, and clean up!  Next time I'm in Vegas I'll find somewhere else to get my nails done."}

{"label":1,"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday. My daughter and I were one of two tables in the whole place. It was just before 9am. Food was fine and prompt... Although a teeny bit pricey. Just as most people have said - service is terrible. No one checked on us the whole time. I had to find someone to get a box for the other half of my wrap. They weren't understaffed by any means - 2 girls at the registers when we walked in, one sitting at the bar eating & a guy was sweeping. As a matter of fact, he & the girl that took\/delivered our order were both sweeping within 5 feet of one another.Then a hotel shuttle dropped off 2 older, manger-looking guys... So was there no management for the 2 hours they'd been open? It was kind of odd.\\nI think the place is cute and could be fun if they trained their staff to be more customer service oriented. And I only happened upon it driving through the parking lot, yet I live less than 2 miles away. Are they doing any advertising? There's a whole community they're missing out on just around the corner. But they've got to get their staffing right before they expect to show people a good time. \\nFinal thought... Sat on the patio as the weather was very cool & felt the only thing missing was a beach :) oh, and our server to see how we were doing.\\nThe end."}
{"label":2,"text":"I've been here a few times now for the unlimited sushi deal.  It's pretty easy to get your money's worth.  However, like most places on campus, the sushi just isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.\\n\\nI always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty."}

Literally 5 minutes after we walked in though we would've been waiting. The service was excellent and the owner even brought us a special anniversary treat on the house! The pizza was delicious too. The bruschetta was very different than any others I've had before. Not bad, just different. We probably wouldn't order it again. The ambiance is also very charming. We had a wonderful time!"}

{"label":1,"text":"Second time I've been here.  The place is quite large and in a good spot.  There seems to be a more tourist crowd here, although there are many locals too.  There is a wide selection of mostly average tasting brunch items.  They do give you a lot of food though, so I think that's nice after a long night out.\\n\\nThe smoothies are ok, but a bit overpriced.  The buttered toast is fluffy and delicious.  Also, I know Canadians love their maple syrup, where they charge you $1 for the real stuff, nothing extra for the fake (I prefer fake, yum)."}
{"label":4,"text":"When you really think about it, most decent restaurants give you a reasonably good meal and do their best to give good service. The rare place takes it to the level of exceptional food and outstanding service. Vic & Anthony's takes it beyond.\\n\\nFrom the moment you're seated to your exit from the well-appointed room, Vic & Anthony's delivers. From steaks perfectly prepared to fresh lobster, excellent sides, and ridiculously decadent desserts, you'll leave only lighter in your wallet. It's expensive, in fact very expensive, but WELL worth it. If you're in Vegas celebrating anything, you could do a whole lot worse at one of the Celebrity Chef palaces on the Strip. Vic & Anthony's may not have the TV chef or the swanky address (The Golden Nugget, an iconic downtown hotel that houses the restaurant, has become quite nice), but it has integrity, a wait staff par excellence, and the best steaks I've had."}

That chick needs to be fired. No wonder people have a complex about dealing with people at the DMV. Die in a fire. Never coming back to this place."}
{"label":4,"text":"STAFF IS GREAT. They are helpful and give fair value on trade items. Also fun to talk with. This location is good for finding rock and metal. Two of the staff members Marcus and Brendan are two of the most knowledgeable when it comes to the screamy-shouty stuff. good used vinyl. CHECK condition. this is the best location to score indie stuff. While the chandler store will have way more titles on cd at $2.99, the Tempe store has better stuff. more imports. more rare cd singles and maxi-singles. Jazz cds are okay. Jazz vinyl not so much. they do have some solid reissues. The country section is small but well stocked on wax and cd. hiphop could be better but if yuo enjoy turntablism and underground hiphop this is your store. Again, to sum up this is the best Zia in town. To all the people complaining about getting ripped off on credit, hate the game not the player. The zia points program is cool, asis the 20% coupon for filling out the survey online."}
{"label":0,"text":"There are so many things wrong with this place. Should I start with the service? I'll start with the service. The staff is usually preoccupied with chatting or card games when you walk in, so being seated, getting menus and ordering water takes 15 minutes. \\n\\nThe food is mediocre at its best, cold and bland at its worst. We  ordered pad thai, spicy fried rice, chicken satay, tom yum gai (arrived cold), red curry and beef larb. Most of it tasted like nothing, the rest tasted like watered down garlic juice. \\n\\nThe prices are high, especially with the long wait between dishes and the staff walking away before we were finished ordering.

From the moment he was admitted to the ER, then subsequently transferred to the hospitals Critical Care Unit on the 2nd floor he received nothing but the best treatment, care and consideration. The doctors and nurses were exceptional.  We were even offered a bed to sleep in so that my sybillings and I could stay the night with him. \\nHe was admitted 4 more times over the last few months.  This was due to failing health. \\nNot due to negligence or early discharge or follow up care.  My mother is now in the rehab unit because she had to have a knee replacement.  Yet again we had the pleasure of the staff and same treatment my father received.  I would hightly recommend Spring Valley Hospital.

I was happy to see that business had picked up. \\n\\nThe bartender was really great, the happy hour specials were cool and the style of the place is nice. It's a bit mis-matchy in design, but that's for another review :) in any event I'm sure I'll be back down for a cocktail or two as they have a descent bourbon collection and I'm a fan of that.

{"label":0,"text":"I had a terrible experience with Todd and Vision Collision. My car was vandalized so I looked for a local repair shop to give business to and found them on Craigslist. Pics of the work looked great so I decided to head down to see what they could do. \\n\\nTodd was about to close up shop but looked over my car seeing that 8 panels would need to be repaired and repainted. I told him it had a dent in the one door that would need to be removed along with dings along the body line, since all 4 doors, fenders and quarters needed to be fixed and repainted. I wanted the whole car repainted since 8 panels had to be done anyway and I believed we had agreed upon that. I also asked for him to work with me on my deductible and he said no problem with that or doing the work. It was all yes-yes and no problem. I signed the paperwork and now it was up to him and the insurance company.\\n\\nI get a call saying the car is being sanded and prepped at the moment and it gets brought up about the 8 panels being repainted and not the whole care. I am a bit taken back by this because I thought we agreed on doing the whole car but chalk it up as miscommunication. If it was not already being worked on I would have picked my car up from them and took it somewhere else.\\n\\nI get a call to pick up my car, he has had it for a week and half so plenty of time to do a great job right? WRONG! I get there and all the door dings are still there, the key mark on the one fender is still visible, paint hazing on the one door and the other fender. I point these things out and he says I have a good eye, no shit I wanted my car right and you were paid $2000 from my insurance company for shoddy work. Basically my car was not repaired to my satisfaction nor to what was written on the estimate for the insurance company and way less what we agreed upon. He did fix the dent on the one door but the door dings are still there along with a key mark on the fender. \\n\\nThe body guy must not have a good eye at all missing all of that and to not repair each panel and get rid of some small dings chalking it up that it is more labor cost for you when I 100% certainly pointed out the dings specifically saying they needed to be fixed and they were not. Regardless of it all the work was not done to my satisfaction and damage was painted over. You can buff out the hazing certainly but you cannot buff out painting over a chip in the paint which should have been sanded down properly nor the key mark which was painted over. \\n\\nI recommend you get it in writing if you make an agreement with Todd or record the conversation because he will over promise and under deliver. He did some of what he wrote up on the estimate but clearly could see I was unhappy. Word of mouth and reviews like these make and break businesses. I will do a HD video walk around and post the link showing the issues I had from my car that was picked up just a few days ago. Totally unacceptable for getting $2000 to repaint 8 panels and not repair them properly, I could have went to nearly any shop and they would have got the handful of dings out and repainted the car for that kind of money. Then telling me its a 14 year old car and not sure what I am expecting. Regardless of the vehicle the work should be done right, my car is a 2 ton business card with over spray on the trim and windows still too!\\n\\nWhen I worked in my fathers shop we went the distance and would never repaint and panel and leave door dings in it or key marks. A couple extra hours of time to make it right because it represents us when it leaves the shop and getting all the over spray off trim and windows because it is not the customers problem to deal with nor hazing of the paint which you can see across the parking lot. Good eye he says, I say open your damn eyes! \\n\\nStay away from this business, you could go to Maaco and they will happily paint over damaged panels. Vision does not go the extra mile or the miles they agree to and are paid well for."}

The Scottsdale store often makes me feel taken advantage of.  \\n\\nSee, the thing about Uncle Sam's is that it started out as a kind-of hangout for high schoolers.  Which explains the haphazard atmosphere, service and menu.  But the food was great and service was efficient and friendly; so the kids just kept coming over the years and now have gotten their kids and grandkids on board.  All the good stuff is pretty much still there at the original location.  \\n\\nThe casual attitude often turns into neglect at the Scottsdale store, though.

When we saw the pathetic plants he replaced them with we were pretty disappointed, then noticed that our neighbors' boxwoods were growing back within a month or so (we wish he would have just left them in and trimmed down instead of ripping them out).

The garlic knots are well seasoned and melt in your mouth.\\n\\nThe setup is nice, with plenty of seating, including an outdoor patio and an indoor bar. The patio provides a view of Fremont. The bar has a decent selection of alcohol with a few more specialized liquors you won't necessarily find everywhere else.\\n\\nThe service is also good, with staff that is friendly and accommodating. even when the place is clearly slow and they're probably not making what they should be in the way of tips compared to other Fremont Street servers on a Friday night, they still stay cheery and aim to please.\\n\\nBut, the pizza. It's badly made and clearly with the wrong cheeses and wrong seasonings in the sauce. The pizza here tastes like the horribly over sweetened crap you get at dominos. Or used to get at dominos. I think even dominos has figured out how to make a better pizza at this point (not GOOD, mind you, just BETTER).\\n\\nWe ordered a white pizza and a regular one, so the problem was not one pizza alone. Everything was bad.\\n\\nIf you've already had dinner, it's a nice place to grab dessert and drinks on the patio. Just stay away from the pizza."}

I had made reservations for us to stay at the Bellagio and as a surprise to my very Alpha Male ex, made reservations for a couples massage in the Bellagio Spa. \\n\\nUpon arrival we were greeted and lead to our separate changing areas. We were told to take advantage of the spa areas (separate for male and female) and then we could meet in the general area and we'd be called when they were ready for us to come into the massage area. Along the way we were also given a tour of the other facilities that were available for our use. Including the meditation room. \\n\\nSide Note: If you come to The Bellagio Spa, TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDITATION ROOM!!!!! OMG.... When I grow up to be rich and successful, I want to mimic the Bellagio Spa Meditation Room in my house. Imagine a dimly lit room with little waterfalls and reflection pools... The calming sound of running water and a little added sountrack of nature sounds... Breathing in and out, deeply and in rhythm with the sound of water... Ahh.... \\n\\n*snaps back into reality*\\n\\nOk... So we're called and greeted by our masseuse and lead back to our room. The room is a typical spa room that was set up with two massage tables.

I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  \\n\\nI was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?\\n\\nCustomer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere \\\"well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps\\\" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that \\\"he would not\\\" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were \\\"I will not do that for you.\\\"  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a \\\"never event.\\\"  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  \\n\\nMy 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  \\n\\nThanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was \\\"a great idea\\\" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package."}

The people at Woodie's uptown were nice about it, they just didn't fix the problem.\\n\\nEdit:\\nIn response to Steven M. - Originally, we took the car (in 2004) to McDowell, where we had the battery replaced at their suggestion, as the alternator is a rather more expensive repair, so we were encouraged to hold off on the alternator for the time being.  Even replacing the battery was not a cheap repair, but it would be nice if it fixed the problem.  Love saving money and all.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it did not help, so we went to a closer location (Independence, now closed), to have it looked at under warranty, where we were charged another fee to analyze the electrical system.  Despite nothing beyond this fee, and no apparent problems cropping up during this inspection, this did not help either.\\n\\nSo we actually had the alternator replaced in 2005 (approximately one year after the initial visit) at the Tryon Street location, for - you guessed it - another, rather large, fee.  Still didn't help.  We eventually sold the car.\\n\\nTo their credit, this particular car gave fits to at least one other mechanic and a Nissan dealer.  So it may be the car more than Woodie's - but the problem was one that was not resolved in the first, second or third visit, and we kept getting charged the whole way.  But to say that we ignored the advice is misleading at best."}

My stomach was sufficiently full at the end of the meal. \\n\\nMy main gripe with this place was our server. She probably walked by the table only once after the food was served. Both my water and soda supply was depleted, and she was no where to be seen. As I near the end of my steak, I finally catch a glimpse of her and wave her down to ask for a refill on both. She tosses my soda and water onto the table and quickly runs off again. It's times like these where I question the mandatory 18% gratuity rule. \\n\\n3 stars for OK food for a HIGH price."}

They refused me because it wasn't 4 Peaks branded.  I have 4 peaks growlers at home, but it was dirty, so we didn't grab it. When I asked 3 other local breweries what they would do in a similar situation, I was told they would replace the growler or simply fill it. \\nI can understand not wanting to fill a blank growler but refuse me your product?

If water glasses got to low, someone was there instantly to refill. If wine got to low, same thing. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. It was amazing. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we had Beef Tar-Tar, Oysters, and two types of salad, plus rolls. The Beef Tar-Tar was delicious, and the salads were fresh and crisp. Our main course was a selection of Wagyu Skirt Steak, Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, and another cut of steak that I'm currently blanking on, with sides of mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and spinach. It was all served family style so that everyone could try some of everything. I have never had such great pieces of steak...ever. The skirt steak was definitely the winner of the three cuts. The mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth amazing, and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. For dessert, it was a selection of ice creams, gelatos, apple crisp, and sweet potato cheesecake...all of which was out of this world delicious. \\n\\nFor anyone staying in Vegas and in need of a great steak, I highly recommend this place!!"}

This is definitely not one of them.  Our friends ordered steaks which were mediocre at best.  I had the halibut which was dry and had no flavor.  I switched it for the salmon which was dry and also had no flavor.  It didn't end there.  We got the mac and cheese which tasted like kraft easy mac mixed with chopped pieces of deli ham.  The mashed potatoes were chalky and bland.  Im really not sure how you screw up mashed potatoes that badly.  I could have done better blindfolded.  Finally, my wife had the lobster, which was just ok, not great.  Overall, the ambience is amazing, but the food just flat out sucks.  To make matters worse, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy.  Las Vegas has too many outstanding restaurants to waste time and money with this place, especially for the price! I will never go back to this place, or to another one of Ducasse's restaurants for that matter."}

{"label":3,"text":"[I should have written my review right after I stayed at Mandalay but I'm a bit delayed on my blogging.]\\n\\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay in the early part of December 2010.  Over the many visits I've made to Vegas, I never intended to stay at Mandalay due to its location but because the room was comped and didn't feel like paying up to stay closer to the strip, I went with Mandalay.  \\n\\nFirst impressions:  beautiful exterior and interior architecture throughout the property.  Attributes both theme and classic Vegas styles.  \\n\\nCheck-In\\n\\nI arrived at the resort on a Friday late afternoon right around the time when check-in generally begins.  It wasn't as crowded as I was expecting so maybe I just got lucky.   The agent clearly directed my way toward the elevators and a few great tips and onward headed toward the room.\\n\\nThe Room\\n\\nBefore heading my way toward Vegas, I took a sneak peak at oyster.com website where it shows the actual picture of the room I had reserved.  Clearly, it seemed right on so I wasn't disappointed when I entered.  Nice layout and fairly spacious.  \\n\\nThe Gaming Area\\n\\nPretty spacious and large.  Seemed pretty ordinary compared to the other properties.  Definitely more high limit than others but that's definitely expected.  \\n\\nRestaurants\\n\\nCan't say at all because I didn't dine at any of the restaurants on-site.\\n\\n... now, the negative comments\\n\\nI love everything about Mandalay after my first experience, HOWEVER it's pretty far from the center strip area (4 corners--Caesars\/Bellagio\/Flamingo\/Bally's-Paris) area.  I really don't spend much time in the room unless I'm with a significant other :p  but besides that, I'm usually hanging out toward the center strip area so the walk\/cab ride is a bit unfriendly.  I also wish there was some sort of direct monorail system from Mandalay to City Center or to Bellagio instead of taking the tram from Mandalay to Luxor, walk across to MGM and take the tram from thereafter.  \\n\\nSo the question is would I stay there again?  Perhaps if I'm able to get it comped.  Location is far more important for me than the quality of the room or hotel.  I'd have to weigh all of the options then.\\n\\nOverall Grade: A \/ A-"}

Although there was a menu with several options we were only given two. They were ill prepared for dinner service but I can imagine the lunch is any better. I ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap. After returning the wrap I then received the flavorless meat on soggy bread with no sauce. It was not even edible. I was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their money off of a beer they charged us $5 for. The worst part is the website that is so deceiving. We were served food in styrofoam! Sitting in an alley with broken glass and a stereo playing bad music loudly. If you want to experience a little bit of Turkey, I guess the only option you have is to go to Turkey."}

They gave us a multi-thousand dollar written estimate (which required repeated requests to even get anything in writing) and it was hand-written on what appeared to be a scrap of paper.  So unprofessional.  Then, when we spoke with the sales team regarding a possible trade-in, given the price tag to fix my car, they were rude and inflexible. We couldn't get a straight answer or even a return call until ultimately we got in touch with the general manager of the dealership.  Apparently, they have had problems and she and her team are now trying to set things right.  She was the first and only person there that was helpful, and she certainly has tried to make things right.  That said, I was disappointed enough that I will not go back.

The food took an hour and a half to get there (they said 30-45 mins), the delivery driver called us twice, yelled at us and then hung up both times.

They also have single patty burgers and cheeseburgers available, along with two types of veggie burgers.\\n\\nTheir main selling point that differentiates them from the competition is their 100% USDA-certified organic, grass-fed, free-range. I like the beefiness and juiciness of the patties, but they have a distinct taste that's unlike your typical fast food\/fast casual burger. If they just seasoned them more they would be so much better. The buns are soft and chewy, the fries are good, and the toppings are diverse -- including their tangy Elevation sauce, a balsamic mustard, and 6-month aged cheddar cheese.\\n\\nTheir large cookie isn't so large. It's a chocolate chip oatmeal pecan cookie that's shaped like a small hockey puck. It does, however, pack a tasty punch.\\n\\nIf you're lactose intolerant I wouldn't recommend their chocolate shake. It's pretty much melted ice cream that's incredibly rich and creamy.\\n\\nMy kid wasn't a fan of their grilled cheese. They take their hamburger buns, turn them upside down and place cheese in between them. Not traditional by any means, and not a hit with my four year old.\\n\\nTheir staff has been friendly and informative on my visits -- always willing to answer any questions -- and the interior is reminiscent of Chipotle, but lighter.\\n\\nAs expected, it's pricier because of all the organic, sustainable ingredients.

The decor fit with pink and white ceilings and oversized lamps somewhat like a venue where you would host a little girl's princess themed birthday party.  We shared a $14 BLT and it had too much mayo but was still BLAND BLAND BLAND. Thumbs down.

There really is nothing extraordinary about this buffet, other than the fact that it is in the Paris hotel.  The buffet is not really long either!  I remember there being a lot of fishy foods, which I could careless for.  The wait line on a Sunday evening was 1 hour!  It is NOT worth the wait!"}

{"label":1,"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I have a soft spot for diners and dives (not so much drive ins). And this place has the traditional diner set up on the inside located in an area of town (the Melrose) that I'm really rooting for to turn into something truly special (it's already pretty cool). But, I just didn't like the food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was eggs, sausage and cheese on a croissant. The croissant was ehhh ok. The eggs\/sausage\/cheese was greasy and not very flavorful. It came with a side of potatoes which were also pretty m'eh. I'll give this one another shot at some point."}
{"label":2,"text":"Boiling Crab has some good shrimp and decent oysters.  Oysters were on the smallish side, but the shrimp were nice and plump!  One of the newer seafood spots in town, Boiling Crab lets you order seafood by the pound with your choice of sauce.  I went for the Whole Sha Bang sauce, which is a mix of each individual sauce (garlic, cajun, etc.).  The sauce was certainly garlicky, but it lacked that delicious punch that makes you crave more heat.  When it comes to restaurants like this, it's all about the sauce, and sauce was just alright for me.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant itself, it is spacious and littered with (small) TV's.  Lots of seating available, both tables and booths.  Walking in, it was nice to not be overwhelmed by the smell of their special sauces, probably due to the large space.  During my visit there were several large groups that came by, and there was no issue with seating 20 or so people together.  One interesting thing that we noticed was the amount of wait staff working.  We got there around 4:00pm, and there were about 25 people working.  Based on the amount of customers at that time, everybody could have had their own individual server!\\n\\nOverall Boiling Crab is a decent spot, but their sauce did not win my heart."}

{"label":0,"text":"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\\n\\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\\n\\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\\n\\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\\n\\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\\n\\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\\n\\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\\n\\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\\n\\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \\\"retouched photos\\\" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\\n\\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job."}

{"label":2,"text":"Pig in a Fur Coat did not live up to my expectations. I had heard SO many good things about the restaurant from Yelp reviews and friends that I expected to be blown away but was sorely disappointed. First, I was not a big fan of the ambience. I didn't enjoy sitting on these tall long tables despite having multiple empty tables where my party of three could be accommodated. It was strange to share the same table with other groups in a half empty restaurant.\\n\\nSecond, the food was just okay. We had:\\n1. Poutine with foie gras, cheese curds, and poutine sauce - I did not enjoy this but members of my party did. It was just fat on fat on carbs so I couldn't handle it. Poutine sauce tastes like mystery sauce, and foie gras was interesting but not my thing. Overall, creative dish but tastes awful.\\n\\n2. Ravioli with duck egg, bacon, ricotta, brussel sprouts, brown butter. This is such a letdown. Duck egg tastes very similar to chicken egg especially covered in so much sauce. Bacon is one measly thin piece but probably my favorite part of the dish. Everyone in my party didn't like this dish and thought it wasn't worth the price although very well-presented.\\n\\n3. Pork belly - I thought this was most worth the hype and price. I loved the pork but was grossed out by the pork intestines. My party LOVED this dish though! It's creative in Madison context but seems like pretty typical Asian dish.\\n\\n\\n4. Sicilian Sfingi with chocolate, orange - MY FAVORITE dish by far!! I usually don't like dessert, but this one is a perfect fluffy round ball of chocolate mixed with just a hint of orange flavor. Yummy! I would go to Pig in a Fur Coat JUST FOR THIS! \\n\\nWe also each ordered wine and loved all of our wine choices. Maybe I set the bar too high or ordered the wrong dishes. I'd love to give it a second chance maybe with people who've been here before and can decide on better menu items."}

Very rude* \\n\\nwe had a nice server so he is mostly excluded from this review. the rest of the experience was really disappointing and our whole party wished we would have left and gone somewhere else all because of how things started off. \\n\\nlet me just say this place was practically empty the whole time we were there. there were a few people but most tables were empty. it was a pretty early dinner reservation. \\n\\nwe originally only had 6 people confirmed for dinner the night of my birthday celebration but we had 4 more people confirm last minute. we called as soon as The Breadfruit opened to see about extending our reservation. They told us they would only accommodate groups of 6. \\n\\nthis was a huge pain bc it was an hour before our reservations and people were already on their way. we were able to convince them to reserve a 2nd table next to ours on the patio so we would all fit and be able to sit near each other. Only after they confirmed we'd be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course. \\n\\nupon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners. \\n\\nwe asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option. we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all. \\n\\nlike seriously?! you can't make any exceptions?! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly wasn't possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up. it doesn't change anything!!!  our group could have sat together for crying out loud. it was totally possible. so stubborn and rude. \\n\\nso that really set the mood for all of us. if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there. \\n\\nbut we endured it, tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good. i loved their pina colada redux. the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking \\\"what the heck, yelpers?! why did so many people recommend this?\\\". my jerk chicken was tasty. \\n\\nabout 95% of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke(it sounded like they had a nice area just for this). the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird. \\n\\nwhile the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc shouldn't you do that when the whole party is around? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks. i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it. it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free. it was a really sweet gesture though (but just fyi...dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called. better known as barf pie. i totally understand why they give that one away for free. no one would pay for that. just saying). but still, really kind birthday gesture. *ok, after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie. i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose*\\n\\nthey don't usually let people split the check (we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu) but our nice server offered to let us... only he made us divide everything up for him. i mean, isn't that his job? i get that it isn't normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us. plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks. it's the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups. this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something. ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome.\\n\\ni def won't be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience. \\n\\nthis place really is only good for super small, intimate settings. i wouldn't recommend going here with more than 4 people. they make it known that they don't really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you're with a group.\\n\\nAlso, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit."}
{"label":0,"text":"I was soooo disappointed :( I had high hopes for this place. I lived in Chicago for a few years and was happy to learn there was a Chicago style pizza place. Sadly, it does not compare to the pizza I would eat in Chicago. The sauce on the stuffed pizza tasted like it was just tomato sauce out of a can. There was absolutely NO seasoning in it. The spinach was fresh, but it wasn't completely covered by the sauce, so many of the pieces were dried out. The cheese was okay, but not great. The crust was pretty nondescript. I definitely won't get another stuffed pizza from here. If they use the same \\\"sauce\\\" on the thin pizzas I definitely won't get pizza from here again."}

The great thing about any restaurant at the Sante Fe Station Casino, there's almost no wait to be seated.  Yes, our locals at casinos located off the strip aren't here to eat.  Most are here to gamble.  We arrived with a group of 12 and our orders were taken almost immediately.  I ended up getting their chicken fajitas with double meat. I also asked that all the fun stuff (i.e. sour creams, guacamole, beans, rices, cheese, etc) be put on another plate. One last request was to have my chicken clean meaning no seasoning added.  After what seems like an eternity to get our food, I got half my request right.  Some, not all, items were put on another plate.  But I got my chicken clean, which is the most important.  Taste wise, I was satisfied and know it would have been better if I had the fun stuff added.  Our waitress was great and our server pleasant.

(Of course we picked it, in honor of Dr. Beverly Crusher, a.k.a. Gates McFadden!) \\n\\nUnfortunately, this place never quite lived up to Quark's\/Spacebar at the Hilton. Though we (by \\\"we,\\\" I mean my beloved family of Trekkies) handed off the specialty drink list once served at Quark's to McFaddens (ah, the passing of the flame), McFadden's failed to make a spark when \\\"replicating\\\" the drink menu. Several times I received the wrong drink from the same bartender. Fortunately, she made the correct drink when informed of her mistake, and I guess it's understandable that they may not be on top of a new drink menu, but I guess the main issue is that despite the several months notice given to McFadden's of the drink menu and expected number of clientele, they really failed to deliver. \\n\\nI also wished they'd had a better set up for dancing. Wednesday night before the convention was great, with an open floor and DJ. The following nights included live bands, karaoke, and a couple DJs who took up the entire dance floor with their set up. Loved the music they were spinning, but there was nowhere to dance, and the hired girls dancing in their underwear was a turn-off (and I like women, so that's saying a lot.)\\n\\nI never ate the food or took advantage of the $30 all you can drink option (which only extended to well liquor and draft beers) but I hope that we can find a better venture next year, or that they have a better grasp of the drink menu and volume expected . . . and make more room on the dance floor!"}

The french fries are a must get as they are more like fresh chips than fries.  The staff have always been very friendly and helpful.

Delicious. \\n\\nMoving on to the specifics, highlights include:\\n\\nMushroom asparagus flat bread: Seriously beyond the beyond.

The market salad is not an every day option, but really damn good so if this is offered on the day you go, get it as a side to make you feel less guilty about eating all the bready wonders in this place (more to come!)\\n\\nSangria: True grown up grape juice. Maybe *too* much homage to Welch's.  \\n\\nHummus: Good. Possibly great. But the aforementioned flat bread eclipsed the shit out of it. I broke my usual rule to only order hummus in straight-up Middle Eastern restaurants. If the hummus is the only veg option in a place, fine, but there are plenty at Olive & Ivy (read: get the damn flat bread!)\\n\\nAnd then there's the bread that comes out before everything else. Almost focaccia, but of a less heavy texture, these slices of heavenly gluten come with a pesto dipping sauce.\\n\\nNote: do not come here if you're god forbid trying to avoid carbs. Not that this is me.\\n\\nEnvirons: oozes atmosphere, whether you dine out on the patio or the high ceiling dining room (check out the opulent private dining room which is enclosed in glass, just waiting for wannabe Prince Williams and Kate Middletons.

{"label":0,"text":"This is the second time I have been there in the last three years and had a VERY BAD experience.  We went two years ago because it was a great meeting spot after the Great Taste of the Midwest.  The waitstaff and bouncers were incredibly rude, though, and the manager was not to be found\/bothered.  It was so bad, we avoided it last year while in town for the festival.   This year we went back, hoping that things had changed.  While the company has apparently gotten bigger, they are no better.  After keeping us waiting for more than an hour, they had trouble accommodating a party of seven (with two children), even though there was more than enough room at the tables.  The hostess for the biergarten (who was not more than 22 and certainly was embarrassing to her UW education if she was attending there) was very condescending and unhelpful.  She offered to  get her manager, but he or she never bothered to come by.  Then, the waitress, who did not come to our table for 15 minutes after we had been sitting there, refused to get us a round of beers, proclaiming in the most condescending manner,  \\\"I think you need a round of waters first.\\\"  Notwithstanding that this 22-year old was probably an expert in binge drinking, we were not out of control. Or, to the extent that we were, it was only because we were famished and irate from having to wait so long for food and service.  So, we left, leaving me unable to satisfy my anger at being so disrespected by leaving a few pennies for a tip.  Let me explain something to you, Great Dane:  your beer is not that great.  I put it at a three out of ten.  I cannot remember anybody ever being excited about your food.  And, as has now been demonstrated twice, your service is awful.  What you do have is an excellent location for the beer festival.  But that is all.  We ended up having a great rest of our night, free of incidents, at your competitor, the Old Fashioned.  Unless you like being disrespected. I highly recommend nobody be tricked by this bar's location and go back to this place.  I certainly will never go back."}
{"label":1,"text":"Prices are way too high to justify the food costs. Lightning is too bright and the restaurant is dead. The location kills them. We were the only ones there Friday at 7 PM. \\n\\nFood is very, very average. Paying $18 for 8 rolls is really absurd. Go to Cowfish or Nikko's for sushi, Baoding for Chinese. This fusion \\\"do it all\\\" falls very short.\\n\\nService was good, you can tell they are trying to make an impression, but my guess is this stays open less than a year."}
{"label":2,"text":"I've had pretty bad experiences going to TAO Nightclub. Reason being that the place likes to pack it all the time with no room to dance and no room to walk around because you're bound to bump into people. TAO Beach was no different. Small pool area and they packed this place also with no room to hang out. Luckily it wasn't a big event here at TAO even though we were on the guest list and had to arrive before 11am in order to get a purple wristband. For what though? Men weren't given free drinks from 1pm - 2pm. Only the women were able to get free drinks. We didn't know and some of us ended up paying and some of us didn't. \\n\\nHowever, day clubs are usually fun no matter what and even though I came here with low expectations which I'm glad I did, I ended up having a good time here. Music, drinks and people hitting the beach balls at each other made it a good time. Even if the water became cloudy after a while when the pool got packed. Main pool was packed as well as the smaller one towards the back of the area. Locker room proved useful but be sure to chip in with friends to make it worth useful as $20 is too much for one couple. If you didn't reserve to get a chair or a cabana, this is not the place to go to if you want to relax unless you're thinking of just staying in the pool the whole time. Just make sure you get there early to get a spot in the pool. If you don't have space, you're better off going outside of TAO Beach and just relaxing at the bigger pool area outside."}

{"label":4,"text":"I'm a regular here at the Blind Pig, and I've tasted about half of the menu so far. Just about every item on the menu is really quite enjoyable. Here are some of my favorites aka MUST TRY:\\n\\n*BP BURGER*\\n\\nAh, the Blind Pig Burger, aka the \\\"BP Burger.\\\" Amazing juicy burger with bacon on it. Go protein style (wrapped in lettuce) if you're trying to cut the carbs.\\n\\n*KALE & GREENS (salad)*\\n\\nSurprisingly one of the best salads I've had that included Kale, which is typically bitter and tough to chew. The unique mix of ingredients (broccoli, cucumber, avocado, soy beans, glazed pecans, & green apple with agave mint vinaigrette) is really delightful when it hits the tongue.\\n\\nOrder this with a side of salmon, and you'll enjoy it even more. Total comes out to about $20.\\n\\n*BLIND PIG CHOPPED (salad)*\\n\\nThe Blind Pig Chopped salad is really good and has a tasty vinaigrette drizzled all over some deli-sliced chicken, garbanzo beans, provolone cheese, pepperocinis, salami, tomatoes, and red onion. \\n\\n*MEATBALLS*\\n\\nA fantastic combination of beef, pork, and veal. You get like 5 or 6 of them, which is just enough to appetize two hungry people before getting into their real meal.\\n\\n*ROAST TURKEY CLUB*\\n\\nThis sandwich is plenty of food for anyone that is hungry. As simple as it is, its thick, and comes with a pickle and a side, so you better be hungry, or ready to get a box to bring home. One of my favorites!\\n\\n*SHRIMP & LOBSTER MAC N' CHEESE*\\n\\nHonestly, if I wasn't interested in staying in good shape, I would probably order this every single time. Its simply amazing. Shell pasta filled with a delectable combination of chopped up shrimp & lobster served with white cream sauce. Are your taste buds salivating yet?\\n\\n----------------------\\nNow, lets talk about some of the NOT SO GOOD dishes:\\n----------------------\\n\\n*CHICKEN WINGS*\\n\\nThese are just, plain, chicken wings. If you're gonna spend the money to eat somewhere nice like the Blind Pig, don't waste the experience on these tiny wings. They're tasty, but too small, and you only get like 6 of them.\\n\\n*SHRIMP & LOBSTER ROLL*\\n\\nI tried this on a recommendation to try something else on the menu, and it was just too salty for my taste buds. Its basically a creamy shrimp & lobster salad inside of a piece of over-buttered garlic bread.\\n\\nI have yet to try any of their pizzas yet, but I've heard that they are amazing as well, and that I'm missing out. Soon my friends, soon.\\n\\nP.S. I accompany just about every meal with coleslaw. No reason really other than its the healthiest side on the menu. I would get the potato salad, but they make it with white potatoes, and I really only prefer red potatoes.\\n\\nOverall, everything on the menu is really enjoyable.

Service is lacking - we had to wave at our server multiple times before hunting her down for a beer refill.  When we received our sandwiches, they were disgusting.  My grilled buffalo chicken sandwich had an unusual (bad) char taste to it and so did the bun.  It took several hours\/beverages, etc before the char taste left my mouth.  There was no sauce on it and the side of ranch was missing.  My husband's medium Gritty burger also had the same weird burnt flavor to it and so did his bun.  We didn't advise the server of our issues since we needed to get going and didn't have time to wait for new orders.  We ordered chocolate milk and they must pour syrup in it and mix it up - this time, the milk was white and the syrup was clumped in the bottom.  We have noticed a decline in popularity of this restaurant - there are fewer people patronizing this place then when we've visited for lunch previously.  Bring back consistency and this place will do well again since Sun Prairie lacks all kinds of dining options."}

She brought out a nice chocolate cake for us to enjoy on our anniversary. The only negative I could really say is that it was Salsa Night so we expected the Band to play Salsa music but they played more modern Latin music (stuff you could hear on the radio). We actually enjoyed it more every time the DJ played music, everyone got up and danced. We would definitely come back in the future."}

I'm sure there are better family experiences in Vegas than the Luxor! We were ill-informed."}
{"label":3,"text":"I just indulged myself with Dinner for the first time at Verrado Grille last night, and I must say that it was a great experience under the circumstances. \\n\\nThey close at 9 pm and we got there at about 8:30, so I was expecting poor service because of our timing. Our waitress was nice, and the service was still good for being almost closing time. \\n\\nI had a pint of Verrado Ale (which is 8th street from Four Peaks) and ordered the Almond Encrusted Basa, which was a beautifully cooked white fish with this delicious Orzo\/Risotto side. \\n\\nThe price is right about ball park for the level of quality you get, I would even pay up a little more for it. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience and I would recommend that you aim for a sunset dinner, as the view over the golf coarse and the white tank mountains is amazing during that time."}

{"label":3,"text":"What a cute and cosy spot to set up \\\"office\\\" for a few hours. It's a large space for a coffee shop, the kind of place that's so warm that it fogs up your glasses when you walk in the door. There's a definite sense of neighbourhood at Hoche. Adorning the walls are community posters for events and a live music acts. There's groups gathering to chat, individuals pouring over books and others like us working away on our laptops. With big mugs of coffee or pots of tea perched atop large wooden tables, it's a spot where you can feel comfortable hanging around for a bit. \\n\\nWatch out for the trickly loo situation. The men's and women's bathrooms are separated. You'll see the ladies when you walk in the front entrance, and you'll see the men's when you are sitting in the back. There is clearly an icon on each door, but because they're not near each other, it's pretty easy to go to the wrong door. \\n\\nOfferings are of your run-of-the-mill varieties: lattes, chai lattes, teas, coffees. They also offer some baked goods for snacking. And of course, no neighbourhood coffee shop is complete without some solid wi-fi to surf on. Make sure you snag the code when you order your bevvie."}

{"label":0,"text":"I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer.  On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared.  For example, the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy, with oil oozing off of batter - a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature.  When broccoli and beef over rice was offered, take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food.  For a dish over $5, there should be more than two pieces of beef.  Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold, with cheese not even partially melted.\\n\\nAs this is a student run enterprise, let's hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves!"}
{"label":3,"text":"Trust me, splurge on a Go room.   But be prepared for plenty of pink.  And a very, very long line at check-in.\\n\\nFor the money, on the location, the petite Go Room is all you need as a home base in Vegas.  Mine was immaculately clean upon arrival, with crisp sheets and a comfortable coverlet on the king-sized bed.  \\n\\nThe Go Rooms aren't for everyone, though.  I was puzzled at first about the frosted glass surrounding the bathroom, and the ambient pink glow that diffused through the glass.  I ended up using the bathroom as a tacky Flamingo-pink nightlight.  (Since I usually end up leaving a light on in a strange place to keep from having a 3AM \\\"Where the hell am I?\\\" moment, this worked for me.)  The bathroom door was on a slider, which kept the room from feeling cramped.  \\n\\nA lot of the room's space is taken up by the bath, and there's a lot of little touches to make this space feel upgraded.  The shower has some additional jets, but, they can't be angled, so at my short height, they were more awkward than luxurious.  I would have liked a tub, but, my room didn't include one.  There was tons of hot water and great water pressure, so no real complaint about the shower other than the lost opportunity to have it be just a little more fabulous.  The hidden television in the mirror was an amusement, and kind of neat when getting ready in the morning.  Toiletries supplied were a touch better than average, but I'd recommend hitting the Walgreens up the street for an upgrade.  \\n\\nThe luxury room faced the strip.  The 17th floor had a spectacular view of Caesar's palace and the Bellagio fountains.  But, a strange screen material made the view hazy -- it took me a while to realize that the screen was the building-sized advertisement for the Donnie and Marie show.  One of the best parts of staying at the Flamingo is that unlike Caesar's, you don't have to stare at that eyesore of an advertisement!  \\n\\nSoundproofing was reasonably good, though I could occasionally hear a loudmouth next door.   The bed was comfortable.  And despite my repeated attempts to tip my maid, money was never, ever removed from the room. I felt that my belongings were secure, though, if you've got really valuable items, there's an in-room safe for them.  \\n\\nDeeply disappointing, though is the $13.99 wired internet charge despite a premium price for the room.  Wireless is also available for a similar charge. Internet access is charged per device, so, choose wisely.  Phone service, like most phone service in Vegas, is insanely overpriced - bring your cell phone.\\n\\nThe Flamingo has a small garden with its namesake birds and a few other unusual specimens, a relaxing refuge from all the casino action.  The Vegas ghost tour stops through there at night to tell some spooky tales.  But, late at night, I was approached in the garden by far spookier panhandlers looking for a cigarette handout.  I doubt that'd happen at Caesar's, and it make me question the overall security of the property.  Each night, fliers were slipped under the door - timeshare promos, pizza parlors.  Nothing terrible, but, it appears that the Flamingo doesn't necessarily monitor things quite as vigorously as some of its sister properties.  \\n\\nI spoke with a few other guests when relaxing in the garden, watching the wedding parties take their photos.  From what I heard, some other guests encountered uneven service - a diabetic unable to obtain a refrigerator for a regular (non-Go) room, others complaining of sub-par linens on the beds.  So, not all rooms at the Flamingo are created equal, and special requests might go ignored.\\n\\nBut, I'd stay in a Go room again in a heartbeat.  The close proximity to the Strip and the relatively petite size of the property compared to a lot of the other megacasinos nearby makes this a great launching pad for your Vegas adventures.  Stock up the minifridge as your own personal minibar with a trip to the Alberson's up the street, and you've got your own personal haven from the noise and the bustle below when you need an escape."}

The worst offender was the salmon bruschetta which had a mere sliver of smoked salmon.\\nThe antipasto plate ($16) started off on a high note with the prosciutto wrapped goat cheese and halved cherry tomato combo, but took a fall for the worse after the sampling the sliced cheese which looked like it came straight from Albertson's deli. Shoulda gone with another pizza or two instead. A complete rip off, and this is Tempe for chrissake. We ran out of bread and requested more - they charged us extra for this?!\\n\\nThe saving grace was the margarita pizza ($9) - the crust had a chewy yet crispy texture. The sauce was tangy and fresh. The mozzarella cheese was acceptable for a $9 pizza and the basil leaves were generously strewn across the pie.\\nThe wine was reasonably priced, we got a Spanish white for $28 and the cocktail menu seemed interesting. I had the cucumber martini ($9) for dessert - a little on the sweet side but well made. \\n\\nOppps and I forgot to mention the \\\"La Bocca\\\" salad was described as having grilled peaches, which was a selling point for me. When it arrived it came in two bowls and sans peaches. We were charged a split fee, even though we didn't ask for the salad to be split.

{"label":1,"text":"Conceptually you would think this place would be a hit! I mean sushi is hot right now. But the actually place has much more to be desired. First of all the menu is lackluster. I mean its a sushi place with barely any sushi! I could make better sushi at home and I have trouble not messing up a bowl of cereal! I bought a fancy sushi which i think was a rainbow roll and a regular spicy tuna. Neither was anything to shout about.

Three they need to make lunch specials - 1 order of sushi and drink for $5.99 2 orders of sushi and a sushi and a drink for $10.99. something like that.

{"label":2,"text":"I've been taking the light rail uptown to work for 2 and a half years, and all in all, I think it's a good system. It does need to be improved, but it is a good addition to the city, and I can't wait until they expand it so I can use it to get to more places. \\n\\nPositives:\\n-Convenience. I happen to live close to a station and work close to a station, so it doesn't get any easier than that. Even if you don't happen to live near a station, there are several Park & Ride stations for you to leave your car and take the train uptown for a night out, a performance, or a game. \\n-In general, the trains are clean, well-kept, well-lit, and not too crowded. I feel safe taking it and waiting by myself at the stations.\\n-For the most part the trains run on-schedule at reasonable intervals. \\n\\nRoom for improvement:\\n-The stations provide absolutely no weather coverage. Have you ever missed your train? Because I have more times than I'd like to admit, and have been stuck waiting for the next one in the rain. Yes, I was under the awning, but the awning doesn't do anything. Even the large covering at the Uptown CATS station leaves much to be desired. \\n-The trains need to run later hours, at the very least on the weekend. This is not just for the party crowd either. I work in a restaurant that closes at 11 on the weekends, and sometimes servers don't get out until almost 2 am, especially if they're closing. Sucks for you if the last train left at 1 am. There are groups of people besides the 9-to-5ers that depend on the CATS system to work the night shift.\\n-Trains need to be scheduled better when there are events uptown. Panthers game? Concert at Time Warner? Street festival? SCHEDULE MORE TRAINS. And run a double-length instead of a single-length. I have seen a little bit of effort regarding this, but many a time I am just trying to get home from work and get stuck behind 7,000 kids who just got out of Disney on Ice (see my review for Vida Cantina.)"}

We've used it everyday to find awesome restaurants like this one.  I was craving sushi but did not want to spend over $100 and I knew if we stayed on the strip we would.

But let me tell you this place was a lot fun!  The food, the environment, everything was great.  First, the environment was very welcoming.  My wife and I sat at the sushi bar and Choo Choo (sushi chef) was awesome! He was a ball of energy, entertaining, funny, he made the experience great!  Now the food was surprisingly super good.  The fish was super fresh, soft, the tuna melted in my mouth.  I was super impressed how fresh the fish was.  I have many food allergies and they were very accompanying, made changes to the rolls for me and gave me suggestions.  The wait service was just okay, hard to track down for the bill but the sushi chefs made up for them with there energy, enthusiasm and entertaining factor.  Lastly the price, cheapest meal of the trip, so crazy!  We opted out of the all you can eat and just ordered.  Our bill was only $38 after taxes and we had sake.  If I'm ever back in Las Vegas I will absolutely eat there and I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know.  If your looking to have fun, eat great food, and not pay a lot, then I highly suggest.  You will definitely need to take a cab or drive here but it's well worth it."}
{"label":1,"text":"A PERFECT marriage between Party On & Bottom Of the Barrel.  First experience here reminded me of what happens to us all after a few too many to drink.  A friend wanted to show me out and suggested this location to end the night after 2a.m. Lets just say the cab didn't get far before I got back in.  It was a mix of 'clicks' still dancing the night away surrounded by the hopefuls and out of shape-late 40 something's preparing to pounce at the first sight of a wounded gazelle.  Looks like I better try this place out once more under different circumstances as the previous reviews show it may have  potential."}
{"label":0,"text":"Went to El Zocalo tonight to enjoy some good food and also enjoy the ambiance with my wife. I have been to this establishment before and never remembered if the food was good or not. I ordered the Tierra y Mar plate which is steak and shrimp on the grill with a side of rice and beans. I asked for my steak to be done medium, when we received our orders seemed to be 35 minutes later my steak was well done and had not an ounce of flavor to it. The shrimp was so salty I could only eat but one. When the waiter finally came back to see how it was going I told him that I was not happy with the plate. He asked if I wanted something else and I refused. I had tried my wife's plate (chicken Enchiladas) and it was mediocre so I wasn't going to waste my time. At the end of the night the waiter apologized and said that the manager discounted my plate 50%. Why the manager didn't come out to see what I thought was wrong is beyond me. Honestly the only reason I will go back is for the music and the beer, my food experience was sub-par. For the price save yourself some money and go to Rosita's in Mesa or El Rico's in Gilbert. \\nTerrible food experience."}
{"label":2,"text":"I never experienced the White Horse Bar when it was apparently some hive of scum and villainy. When I visited it was perfectly pleasant.\\n\\nJust off of the Royal Mile this wee pub is quite easy to miss. But it might just be worth a visit. The White Horse Bar didn't seem quite a touristy as all the rest. This might just be the most traditional of all the \\\"traditional\\\" pubs along the high street, in that it feels more natural and isn't straining itself to give off a particular image. It is definitely less touristy, and it's also quite a bit smaller than the other nearby pubs. It is perhaps a touch small but this can make it feel quite cosy at times. This pub, I expect, still attracts more locals and regulars, but when I went in they were reasonably friendly to me.\\n\\nA surprising pub that has apparently smartened itself up, and is all the better for it."}

{"label":2,"text":"I really wanted to give them more than 3 stars but I just couldn't. \\n\\nDecided to try this place out because my co-worker raved about this place. Plus it was just down the street from my job. The whole restaurant is quite adorable. Two of the walls are glass walls so it added a really cool effect to the place, lighting up the whole room up. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty condensed but I kinda like that. Also everything is a pretty decent price. I asked the hostess for her opinion on what was popular and she was really helpful. I ordered fried fish tacos ($6) & wanted a side of kale salad because of all the positive buzz it gets! I just substituted the beans w\/ kale salad which was $1 extra. \\n\\nI ordered my food at 12:00 & did not get my food until about 12:30. And, it was not even busy. So I suggest you order your food before you arrive. I honesty think 30 minutes for 2 fish tacos is a little too long. A few of the costumers were also complaining of the wait. \\n\\nNow the food. The fish tacos were pretty good. Honestly nothing special about them but nonetheless they were good! The kale salad-- sorry, But I honestly did not like it. I was so excited to try it from all the buzz it got! I thought it was dry and it had a odd after taste. But maybe I'm just not a kale fan lol. \\n\\nI do want to come back & give them another chance.

{"label":0,"text":"DO NOT SHOP HERE! The clothes are darling & the prices are too good to be true.  And it was true - the store is a terrible rip off. First off no one will help you. I asked for help from 2 salespeople & they said no and walked away. When I went to pay, I discovered they cheat you by wringing up higher prices. I checked my receipt before I left. They had a sign that said all leggings $8. But they ring you up\\nFor $9.00. When I pointed this out, the manager, Josefina actually asked me if I wanted the $1 back on each pair I bought. If I had known I was donating to charity, I might not have cared. But I wasn't in the mood to give $1 away which she then threw the bills at me. I had to ask 5 times for the leggings back. I guess only paying $8 for them meant they got to keep them. They overcharged me on a pair of jeans - sign said $20 - they charged $27. I asked to return them & Josefina refused to make the refund and said exchange receipt only. Like I would ever go back into this horrible consumer rip off store!!! I grabbed  a jacket for $20 & exchanged & since I am never returning, I donated the store $7. They must be really hard up to make money if they have to steal from their customers. I so wish I did not have to give them 1 star as they don't deserve it. The only good thing in the store was Jared who worked behind the counter & was as nice as he could be considering all Josefina did was yell at him. NO MATTER HOW CUTE THE CLOTHES ARE IN THE WINDOW - DO NOT SHOP HERE UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING OVERCHARGED AND INSULTED. I  to tell Josefina to stop yelling at me as she was rude). Hell she made $7 off me that she probably put in her pocket.  I THINK YOU WILL GET BETTER SERVICE IN THE 99 CENT STORE. SAVE YOURSELF JARED - find a new job where they will be nice to you & appreciate you."}
{"label":1,"text":"Food was good, but did not match the menu description, and the service was the worst I have ever had.\\n\\nAfter being seated about 7:30 p.m. we were given water and menus right away, and that's where anything I could call service ended.  20 or 25 minutes passed, and someone in our group had to hail down the server to take our orders- they hadn't even come by for drink orders.\\n\\nOur food took a very long time, was lukewarm when it came out, and was extremely skimpy on the portions that matter.  I ordered the shrimp risotto with jumbo sea scallops, and while there was a decent amount of risotto, there were no more than 5 dime-sized shrimp all on one side of the dish, and the scallops were medium size- about the size of a quarter.  Worse yet, they had cut them in half putting the bronzed side up to make it look like more, so the three scallops I was looking at were only 1.5 scallops, and weren't even as thick as my pinky finger.  What was there tasted good even lukewarm, which is why I've given two stars rather than one, but the menu was a complete overstatement of the dish.\\n\\nThe couple in our group that had ordered the prix menu had to hail the waiter over to get their dessert and check so that they could make their 10 pm show, the rest of us, clearly also ready, had to hail him again after he disappeared after taking care of them (they did make their show, but missed some of the pre-show).  The other thing that really bugs me is that we were seated there over 2 and a half hours, saw a manager around, but they never approached our table for the standard \\\"how is everything\\\".\\n\\nIf you insist on going to this restaurant (and with so many wonderful options in Vegas, I don't know why you would), do NOT go with 6+ people- it was very apparent from the evening that the servers were guaranteed their 18% automatic tip for groups, and thus completely blew us off."}

{"label":1,"text":"Outback Steakhouse\\nMultiple Locations\\n\\nWith all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try Outback. It was a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. We chose not to have anything from the bar, and instead stayed non-alcoholic for the evening.\\n\\nCompanion #1 ordered a bowl of potato soup. It arrived hot, with nice chunky potatoes sticking out of the soup along with large pieces of bacon. No complaints were heard. Companion #2 ordered the Cesar Salad. It seemed run of the mill, and companion noted that it was a bit heavy handed on the cheese.\\nI ordered the regular salad with the honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a nicely done salad.\\n\\nFor main courses, companion #1 ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger. The burger arrived medium but on the dry side, with barely adequate cheese and decent fries. Companion felt she had had better burgers in most fast food places.\\nCompanion #2 ordered the rib eye steak medium rare. It arrived medium rare, but seemed to be poorly prepped in that it had lots of sinew on it, and the tail still had some silverskin attached. Seasoning was adequate but nothing special.\\nI had the Ahi tuna appetizer along with the small sirlion. The Ahi was cooked correctly, but had been pre-cooked hours before, and was greatly over-seasoned. By the time you added the wasabi vinaigrette dipping sauce, the fish had no taste left of its own. In paying for a premium fish like Ahi, the fish should be the central character, and the rest of the condiments are the supporting role. The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered (rare), but lacked flavor and again, still had silverskin attached, making the last piece memorable for its chewiness.\\n\\nWe did not order any deserts.\\n\\nInspection of the restrooms was pleasant enough, in that they were recently cleaned, smelled fresh, and looked nice.\\n\\nOverall, I might rate Outback 2.5 to 3 stars. I've definitely had better at lower prices. BTW if you are tempted by the Blossom, their signature onion and your on a diet, companion #1 says stay far away from it. That one dish alone will use up the entire days amount of points!"}

{"label":1,"text":"I was debating whether to give this a 2 or 3, but after reading other reviews, going with the 2 rating as it doesn't seem like they get customer service.\\n\\nIt started out poorly.  My brother had made a tee time and when he booked it, told the person he had a coupon from the local paper (it was Memorial Day and they were running a special for that day), which they said they'd note on the reservation.  When he checked in (before me), he told the person behind the counter that he had the coupon, and they honored the price.  I checked in about 15 minutes later, and someone new as behind the counter.  I didn't know about the coupon, so I paid for myself and my guest.  My brother came in just after the guy ran the transaction and mentioned the coupon.  At this point, the employee became very difficult.  He told us that he couldn't honor the coupon since I didn't mention it, and it was too late.  He berated us for even suggesting that we ask for a discount after the fact.  My brother told him about telling the person on the phone about it, and how it shouldn't be hard to reverse the transaction especially since the deal was advertised for this day only.  The employee continued to be rude so I just suggested we go play and see if someone else was working when we finished.  As a side note, when we finished, there was someone else and they did give us a $40 refund (value of the coupon) but had to find the owner to do it, which took about 15 minutes.\\n\\nPace of play was very slow, just over 5 hours (which to me, is painful, I'm used to 4 hour rounds at home and we walk...this was 5+ hours with everyone in carts).  We complained to a ranger a few times, but they said the course was backed up (but it seemed to be just two groups playing slow ahead of us).  \\n\\nTees were kind of hairy and hard, not well manicured.  The greens were in good shape though, rolled pretty well, fairways weren't too bad.  Nice layout overall, some good holes.  Overall, a pretty easy course.\\n\\nI didn't use the range, but my brother said the balls were very old and cracked.\\n\\nWe played a course up in Greenville earlier in the weekend, and it was the same price with better conditions and much better attitude from the staff."}
{"label":1,"text":"Went there for dinner on Monday night.  Not real impressed.  The place is not much larger than a Golden Corral.  Being sort of cheap I usually stay at Excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet.  Last Christmas I decided to spend an extra $5 and try the buffet at the Luxor and was well rewarded.  So this year I opted to spend yet another $5 ($26.99 +tax) to see what it got me.  Last year at the Luxor was much better.  Very small salad bar. Limited cooked vegetables.  Several meat and starch dishes, almost all were cold or lukewarm.  Several of the seafood items (hot and cold) were soggy.  I did leave room for dessert and it was very good.  This place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well.  They have several seafood offerings, they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out.  I ate between the opening rush and the 7PM dinner rush so the place was only about 80% full and the lines were reasonable.  My server kept my plates cleared and my Iced tea full.  I did notice this trip the entire MGM family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when I was there in July."}

{"label":0,"text":"Here is a honest review from an Indian Tempe veteran !\\n\\nThis review was long overdue but finally its here. I don't know where to start on this place. As one person mentioned below this place is like run down has barely 4 tables with plastic chairs and always dirty tables surrounded by 3 isles of groceries facing kitchen and toilet. No one ever comes to take your order and you have to grab a menu item list and fill what you want and go to the kitchen to hand them what you need and people from the kitchen giving you weird looks as if we are forcing them to cook food for us. I have been to this place when i was the only customer and still took a long time for them to serve. Often the next 3 orders are served before you so that you look stupid waiting there.\\n\\nRegarding food , they serve in paper plates, get your own water in paper cups and food is less quantity and not so tasty. They barely make efforts to cook great food. The paneer mutter has 2 minute cubes of paneer and loads of green peas and the curry is tasteless. Chole bhature is bad too and their so called \\\"veg pulao\\\" is nothing but yellow rice with cumins seeds and not even close to be called a pulao. This is what they serve for 6$. Thinking about snacks their paani puri has 6 old stocked puris and paani(sweet water and green water) which is not so authentic plus they serve samosa potato filling as stuffing which is fooling people who dont know what paani puri is. Their other snacks i did not try but from what my friends ordered were equally bad. Their quantities are bad too. But their samosas are decent not as bad.Their kitchen has the owner wife and other exploited less wage paid women working with whom you have a hard time communicating. i observed they sometimes keep some basic food items like pickles, tomato purees, paneer mutter left over and etc inside refrigerators for use when needed. GREAT serve us stale food.\\n\\nTheir grocery store stocks all expired and smelly stuff which is not overpriced than other indian grocery stores. I bought groceries just because they refuse to take credit card below 10$ and they hate AMEX. Once i asked the paan eating owner that the item is expired and instead of being polite he said \\\"you should pick and choose items correctly\\\". I bought some snacks which had a stored smell and the pohas(flatten rice) was not good quality(confirmation from indian parents visiting). The grocery store is a risk as you can end up messing up your stomach.\\n\\nMy final advice to people with the intent of going here for lunch\/snacks\/dinner is good luck to get served mediocre food and some of my indian friends will agree to this. Grocery store definitely there are other places to go ask your fellow indian friends. Also i can't tolerate the owner who always chew paan and talks weird to you."}

It was over cooked, rubbery and way to thin. However, it did have a good flavor. The macaroni salad was very good and they were happy to replace the rice with a green salad at no extra cost.  The short ribs were very tough and cut thin, again the flavor was good. The coconut shrimp tasted like it was just ordinary frozen restaurant fare, nothing special. I really wanted to like this place as we need more family run places and not chain eateries. We were there from 5:30 to 6:30 and we were the only ones in the place the whole time. Too bad.

{"label":1,"text":"I work very nearby this particular Steep & Brew, and it is consistently hit-or-miss, as contradictory as that sounds.

Months would go by without hearing from them and when you'd send an email, there would be no response. When you called, they would say there was an 'email problem' and to send it to a different email address.

No, but we see someone TRIED to file an extension on June 17th.  Of course, when I called Total Business Solutions, Jason was 'traveling', but would get back to me the following week.

The outside area is surprisingly cool, even in the depths of summer (at least around 9pm, when it was still 95 or so outside) thanks to powerful fans and good misting. \\n\\nThe food is pretty good. I like the pretzel bread fondue and my go-to meal is the fried chicken, which is really juicy, though I wish they'd put a bit more into the mashed potatoes\/gravy they have going on.\\n\\nThe Yard has live music pretty often, and on our visit, this was a pretty serious disadvantage. It wasn't just that it was loud. It was loud and pretty awful. Lots of different covers spanning all kinds of genres ensured that we'd hear some of our favorite hits from the 60s, 70s, and 90s butchered. Not pleasant, and we were excited when they went on break.\\n\\nOur server was really nice and pretty well got everything right, and the food is definitely decent enough for a return visit... but to the regular Culinary Dropout, where I won't have to dodge a dodgey live band."}

If you don;t want anything that heavy i am also a fan of their low carb breakfast...Their dinner pasta bowl is also really good-i'm not the biggest fan of their lunch though, not that it isn't good, it's just that i expected it to match how much i love their breakfast-but you might have a different taste.  The other reason this isn't a 5star rating is also because they can take a long time.  Most of the time it's fine because they are making it from scratch but sometimes it goes over average and when that happens you would think it would be better than the last time but they aren't the most consistent. \\nPlease-go here for breakfast and try it, it's a great neighborhood coffee place."}
{"label":1,"text":"Although the ambiance, wine store and service is superb, I find this to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Las Vegas. To describe the food as lack luster is actually kind. The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was \\\"wonderful\\\". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.\\nThe wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you."}

Not a ton of the designers I like - I find most of what they sell for women is either too young (such as BCBG) or too fuddy-duddy (such as Reba McIntyre's clothing line) for my age range and style.  But they usually have some pretty good sales, so I always pop in to see if I can find any unique Michael Kors, Calvin Klein or Elie Tahari pieces.  There have been a lot of times I've seen an item in Canada and have gotten it a lot cheaper here.  Great shoe department - I think they could do a bit more to spruce up their accessories department though.  It is an older store and somewhat in need of a makeover."}

Although the wait staff is nothing short of unskilled and unprofessional. THREE out of the four times i came the drive through was closed. Whats the point of a drive through if you never use it. I came in at 2pm on a Tuesday. There was one barista ringing in orders and a line of about four people ahead of me. She was one of the slowest cashiers ever, the woman being serviced demanded a gift card for next time due to poor service. When it finally was my turn, I ordered a mocha light frappacino with added whip cream. Thats not being too difficult is it? Apparently to the barista it was. As I waited for my drink the man ahead of me told here she forgot the cream in his coffee and he stood there for about five minutes because she had to \\\"get more half and half\\\" . Ugh. He was visually upset too. Then when my drink was served, it was a coffee frappacino! I told her my order once again and she made me a mocha light frappacino and for got the added whip.

Grabbing some basics is fine (apples, milk, toilet paper), but procuring anything out of the ordinary is more challenging.  (insert sarcasm)  Case in point: my husband decided to make blueberry bran muffins and needed some wheat bran.  He goes to this Walmart, assuming that it would carry bran.  After a futile search, he asks an employee where the bran is and she just looked blankly at him.  The following is the conversation he had with said employee:\\n\\n\\\"Bran?\\\" \\n\\\"Yes, you know, as in bran muffin bran?\\\"  \\n\\\"OH!  The muffin stuff is in the baking aisle.  You can find all the mixes there.\\\"  \\n\\\"Uh, I'm making bran muffins from scratch and need wheat bran.  Oat bran is also good if you don't have bran.\\\"\\n\\\"We don't carry bran.  You'll have to go to a specialty baking shop for that.\\\"\\n\\n*crickets*\\n\\nHe made plain blueberry muffins instead.\\n\\nAnother gripe I have about this Walmart is the self-checkout register.

And if you want to use your own shopping bags at the self-checkout?  Good luck.  \\n\\nStore clerks are generally pleasant, if their zen-meets-zombie-like state can be classified as pleasant.  \\n\\nPrices are what anyone would expect from a Walmart: inexpensive.\\n\\nSigh.\\n\\n(Tip: the code for bulk carrots is 4562.)"}

The tako salad was quite tasty, although it was absolutely drowned in ponzu sauce, so beware!\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't consider this as a \\\"destination\\\" to go back to; however, I wouldn't say no if I were invited to go eat here again."}
{"label":1,"text":"When in Vegas, you have to know your way around. I like to think that I'm pretty knowledgeable about the club scene. Well, my girlfriends and I happen to be in Vegas on a Wednesday so we decided to hit up Eclipse. Since discovering Surrender's nighttime pool club, we've been a fan of that scene since. We got a $500 comped table from a host, Kwame, who was awesome btw! He got us checked in and everything ran smoothly. \\n\\nWelp, that's where it ended. Our waitress, Kelly, was awful. Awful awful lady! She didn't seem to want us there. She over poured our drinks, which I assume to get us to buy a new bottle quicker. My group of girls are all pretty petite, I think you can assume that our tolerance isn't that high. She made us 6 drinks, and the entire bottle was almost finished. You can only assume that those were some stiff drinks! Then when we found out we got charged for 8 water bottles, totaling to over $50 we were super annoyed with the fact that she was annoyed with us. She tells me, \\\"You said you wanted water.\\\" I kindly replied, \\\"Yes, I did want water, as a mixer for my vodka waters, but I did request 8 bottles.\\\" Especially at such a high price! I'm not that frugal but her attitude stunk! She made me feel cheap. Look lady, your 22% gratuity may already be included, but you can at least try to act like you're working for your money! After that, she took our whole bottle service away, just as quickly as we finished our last drop of vodka. RUDE! I've never felt so rushed and embarrassed. And the shitty thing is that her tip for her hour and a half of waiting on us, which was very minimal might I add, was over $130. \\n\\nEclipse, itself is okay. Big ordinary pool in the center so you can walk around the entire perimeter. DJ set up is at one end of the pool and the bar was opposite of that. It wasn't too visually appealing though. Nothing to rave about. Not visually stunning as you'd like and hope for."}

Dropped in last night to see what the buzz was about and ordered the Fillet & Jumbo Shrimp with fresh lemon grass which was made with perfection with a perfectly balanced dipping sauce served with a side of rice, a small bowl of the pho soup stock and a tasty side salad. Dennis and Hue brought out  a  Cornish Game hen that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, these culinary marvels don't mess around!!! and of course it also came with a wonderful dipping sauce. Both dishes were superb not to mention the hospitality from Dennis the proprietor who tells me he only  uses the freshest ingredients and boy your palate sure notices the difference. The food quality exceeds the price of the menu, I would pay double for the quality given here.

We wanted to arrive early to obtain good seats.... we should have listened when they said don't arrive to 30-45 minutes early.. THERE IS NOTHING HERE.. it is strictly a bus depot, with the characters you except to see, the homeless, the trying to get home, the runaways - speaking of ... there was entire wall just dedicated to run a away children.. well that just ruined my weekend.  There are only a few tables inside and vending machines...I was thrilled with the bathroom either only because you could enter the woman's' and men's' very easily , there was no door.. it was a 2 way entry so anyone could grab you as you walked in. \\n\\nIt's not that bad if you are only waiting for about 30 minutes, but for the 3 hours early we did it was a horrible...

That was the beginning of our nightmare.  We got to the resort in the evening time the village was just very disgusting with the stench of sewer from what i could tell.  Like other have said the village is a ghost town and the stores that are conducting business are always closed from what I experienced.  They have a lot of empty commercial space available, that should have been a sign for me.....  I complained about what seemed to me was a truck running all night pressure washing something in the village and was told by the front desk \\\"we have no control of what the village does or doesn't do no matter the time of day\\\".

We all did the build your own burger so she asked us to write our names on our orders so there was no confusion about who ordered what but this proved pointless. After waiting 45mins one burger came out with no name or any knowledge of what was even on the burger. The waitress took it back to the kitchen to find out whose it was 20mins later a different burger came out with no name so that one was taken back to the kitchen also. Finally 40mins after the first burger was taken back, all 4 came out. Not one burger was right or what we ordered and when one said they ordered a pretzel bun the waitress said she would bring the bun so we can reassemble the burger at the table ourselves. We were clearly aggravated with her response and so she proceeded to roll her eyes at us every time she walked by our table and would refuse to check on us after the food was brought out.

{"label":0,"text":"No hotel is perfect, but I've stayed at this hotel three different times and something always happened. I just got back from staying at the Cosmopolitan and I was disappointed with what went down. First night I checked-in to my room I noticed that my entire floor smelled like mildew. As soon as I got off the elevator I could smell something rancid. The manager offered to send someone up to the floor to spray it along with my room, but it did very little to help. The next morning I woke up, opened  the blinds to go outside onto the balcony, and at the base of the sliding door I see a bloody and used condom! A manager came up, we talked for a few minutes, and then they offered me a $150 credit to my account. There are a lot of good things about this hotel, but there have been issues with my room\/stay all three times I've stayed there. I've never had issues with the Bellagio, MGM, Hard Rock, or Venetian."}
{"label":3,"text":"If you are on a budget and visiting Las Vegas this is the place to go.  It is one of the biggest hotels on Fremont and had millions of dollars worth of renovations over the past few years.  Most friends I bring here are shocked that such a nice hotel is not on the strip.  The pool is my favorite part.  This is where you find the shark tank with a water slide that goes right through the middle of it!  It is a site to see for sure.\\n\\nAnd if you are not staying at the hotel the price of admission is only $20, which is not bad compared to so many of the pools on the strip.\\n\\nThe downside to the hotel itself is because it is not on the strip the air quality is not as fresh.  If you are a smoker this will not be an issue, but if you are a non-smoker this could be a nuisance."}

Having tried many pho places in LV, I keep coming back to this one for one thing...THE SOUP. This is the hands down best pho in Vegas. No questions. It's food crack, really. I just can't get enough. The broth has mystical powers and calls to me at strange times, begging for my return. The noodles and meat mingle in the bath of harmonious flavor and never fail to make me mmmmmmmm. Always order the Dac Biet #10 if you're really hungry or 14 if you're just normal. Tender brisket, delicious flank, melty chewy tendon and tripe if you want it. It's heaven in a bowl, baby.

The owner split our plate in half so we could enjoy this excellent dip.  It packed flavor, freshness, and a delicious spread on top of my pita.  The wifey and I were not able to finish it, and I would have to be so bold to say that it even tasted better the following day.  No way?  Oh yes way, my friend!\\n\\nThere is a ton of hype on the lentil soup, but I would have to say the potato soup had more flavor and was definitely more hearty than the lentil.  Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.\\n\\nThe wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \\\"bam, pow, or crunch!\\\"  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.\\n\\nIt definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!

{"label":3,"text":"As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \\n\\nFirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\\n\\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the \\\"Creole\\\" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\\n\\nThe main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1\/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \\n\\nSorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210."}

The irony!  \\n\\nAs for the food...\\nThe wings looked amazing, but were just ok.  I preferred the red ones over the green since they had more flavor. \\n\\nThe truffle fries were great!

{"label":1,"text":"They should change their name to Fresh, Easy and Fatty.\\n\\nAre you kidding me?  After all the rave reviews of Fresh and Easy,  I waited for the dust to settle and ventured there today only to find it is a major disappointment.  I find this is a view not shared by several of my friends and many trusted fellow reviewers.  \\n\\nFrom many comments I expected a Trader Hoe's type place where I would also have to stop at a Fry's to get everything else...your basics.  Well, it is that to a degree, just not as good in terms of price, quality or health as TJ's.\\n\\nI have never cared for pre-packaged fruit and vegetables -- which admittedly is a criticism I have of Trader Joe's also.  I love being able to select and decide which orange is to my liking at a place like Fry's.\\n\\nMy biggest criticism, however, would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection.  This is where TJ's has them beat.  Sandwiches all weighed in at 50+ fat grams.  An average person's total daily recommended allowance is something like 67 fat grams, so eat the sandwich reeeaaalllly slowly and savor it for the rest of the day.\\n\\nFor a store that prides itself on ecologically-sensitive gestures such as grocery bag recycling, organic foods, priority parking for hybrid vehicles, etc, etc., I was shocked to see how poor their nutrition facts weighed in on many foods -- making a triple bacon cheeseburger look like Lean Cuisine.  Where's the social responsibility in that? \\n\\nSmall 8 ounce containers of chicken salad measured at 88 fat grams and 980 calories are more offensive than slightly higher prices or the absence of ecological gestures would have been.  I mean, seriously, is there any chicken product in that salad at all, or is it just a tub of lard with chicken seasoning?  Perhaps this is some sort of sick joke the Brits are making at their fat-ass American counterparts.\\n\\nI left the store with some fruit salad, organic lemonade and a spicy shrimp roll (which, btw was just as awful as TJ's sushi).  I found that the pricing was no different on many items and in many instances was more expensive at F&E.\\n\\nSorry Fresh and Easy, I don't buy it and I won't buy it.  Trader Joe's, where are you baby?  I'm a coming running back to you."}

Several hours later I returned home to a flooded fridge compartment and kitchen floor.\\n\\nTurns out some of the fridges with water\/ice dispensers they have in the showroom have filters in them - some don't.  In my case, there was no filter in the fridge when it was installed.  When the ice maker kicked on, since there was no filter, the water just poured out of where the filter should be - hence flooding the entire fridge and leaking out onto the floor.\\n\\nI went back to the Outlet and explained there was no filter and was basically told some have them, some don't.  Since mine didn't come with one I would need to buy one for $50.  I spoke to the manager as this seemed ridiculous.  The manager walked around the showroom, found a fridge that had a filter in it, removed it and handed it to me.  I was grateful ... until I got home and it was the WRONG SIZE!!!!  I called the Outlet and spoke to the same manager who said there was nothing he could do, I'd have to go to another parts store and buy one.\\n\\nI went to the parts store the next day, with the wrong filter in hand.  The man there was extremely helpful and was shocked how the Outlet store handled the situation.  He looked up the model of fridge I had and agreed they had given me the wrong filter out of some random fridge.

NOT my idea of a good time. It was awful, and I called to let the manager know that we were very unsatisfied with our meals (it was expensive!) but the manager never returned my call. I think that upset me the most.  \\n\\nNow, we're college girls. We are NOT picky about food. My Cheeseburger In Paradise looked like a Quarter Pounder from McDonalds, which would have been fine if it had tasted as good as a Quarter Pounder.  It was gross.

Keep in mind I went during the week (less busy) and they over charged us for using the refrigerator, pots and pans, the stove didn't work, bell hop showed up 3 hours after we check in, they don't provide hair dryers in rooms so we had to wait 2 hours for one, had two call them 5 times to clear up charges that were wrong, it costs money to use their refrigerator, had to wait 3 hours to check in, they charge your room a \\\"party fee\\\" if you bring booze over a certain limit on the bell hop cart (no other hotel does that). I was comp'd $300 and maybe you are thinking wow that's reasonable. I avidly go to Vegas and if that list of things happened at any other hotel a night or two would've been refunded (I've had that happened). \\n\\nHotel is beautiful yet you will have a headache the entire time from dealing with their shenanigans.

Well, after having checked it out...IMPLODE AWAY, I SAY!\\n\\nEverything in this restaurant is coated in\/soaked in\/bathed in\/wallowing in grease. My friend and I shared the pot stickers as an appetizer -- they were OK, although also glistening with gratuitous grease. As far as pot stickers go...they were like any other potstickers. Except greasier. All the better to slide down your gullet, I guess.\\n\\nNext, I had the much-ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin to describe this monstrosity! I thought the pot stickers were greasy -- this beast was OFF THE CHAIN GREASY! It was like eating a heavily-salted Jheri curl sandwich!! I don't like wasting food, so I managed to choke down half of it before giving up -- but it was G.R.O.S.S. It was SO salty it was almost like they were trying to cover something up. Also, the grease had a weird sort of stale aftertaste, like they use the same fry oil over and over. YUCK! \\n\\nThe fries that accompanied the sandwich were similarly greasy. I know, I know, French fries are called FRIES because they are FRIED -- but these were ridiculous. I've had better fries in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace! The fry grease had the same gross aftertaste as the sandwich, which totally killed whatever was left of my appetite.\\n\\nNow, you might chalk all of this up to my being a veggie-eating commie bastard -- but guess what? My friend, who is most definitely NOT a veggie-eating commie, had the Fat Choy burger...and was similarly grossed out. He reported that it, too, was astonishingly greasy -- although he did finish the whole thing, so it couldn't have been THAT bad.\\n\\nYou might blame me for not having ordered something less greasy than a grilled cheese -- but the menu is extremely limited here (one page only), and since I don't like duck or pork, I didn't want to get the highly-touted bao or any of the rice dishes. I'm willing to bet they are just as greasy, anyway :-\/ In fact, there wasn't much of anything on the menu that grew out of the ground -- it was all lard, grease, carbs and meat.\\n\\nWhat really sucks is, I came in here fully expecting to adore the place -- being as it's located in such a solidly unpretentious dive. Speaking of which.....\\n\\nAfter I gave up on eating, and had sopped the grease off my face with no fewer than thirty napkins, I went out into the casino to have a drink at the bar, thinking I could salvage the evening with a little people-watching and a rum & coke to cut through the grease still coating my tongue. But even that went sadly awry.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's a cash-only bar, and I didn't have any on me. So I had to get raped by the corner ATM, and pay a $5 surcharge...which brought the cost of my drink up to Strip prices anyway. If I'm paying Strip prices, dammit, I want to at least be able to ogle drunk bitches with fake tits, etc. But all I got was a depressing, smoke-filled room full of methheads, with Kenny Loggins playing somewhere in the background. That kind of ambiance is OK if you're in a certain mood....\\n\\n...but when you're already on the verge of vomiting, it ain't no fun! I finished my drink and got the fuck out of there, probably never to return. \\n\\nI never thought I'd say this, but...there are some places that DESERVE to be imploded. You hear that, Tony Hsieh?!!

It is so dark and dreary in there you can barely see. After ordering the pizza we decided to get some beer while we wait. Nothing on tap, but a few craft selections in bottles. We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8 which is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open. It had gone bad. We asked to change it out for Alaskan Amber. That had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away, which I don't do. The pizza was not square as they boast but round. And it looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on their website. Small and scarce pepperoni with a cracker thin crust. Tasted like the pizza you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is it was frozen. We would have been better off getting a freezer pizza and 6 pack from Albertsons across the street. And it would have been a lot cheaper. $26 of junk we through out. We would never go back."}

{"label":3,"text":"Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience."}

{"label":0,"text":"This place is an absolute joke. A lot of the employees are incompetent, rude, and just plain don't care. The manager is clueless which might explain a lot of the other problems.\\n\\nI have never seen a store sell so much food that is way past expiration date. If you tell them it quickly becomes obvious that they do not care.\\n\\nBe careful if you use the bakery because apparently the \\\"bakers\\\" don't understand that when you remove bread from the oven you are just supposed to let it cool before wrapping it, and not let it sit for hours exposed to open air. You can get \\\"fresh\\\" bread that was just recently baked and still have it be like two day old bread! If you happen to mention that you could fracture someone's skull with the bread they are highly offended.\\n\\nGood luck trying to pay the actual cost of items in this store. It's amazing how many \\\"mistakes\\\" they make in their pricing, and the \\\"mistakes\\\" are always to their advantage. If they ring up the wrong price on an item and you show them that the price on the shelf is different, it is likely that they will tell you someone forgot to remove the old price tag. There is a LOT of forgetting in this store. You may well have a problem trying to figure out the actual price of an item given that they have so many schemes where they display a price prominently like it is the actual price, only to find that there is small print that explains all of the conditions that have to be met before you will get that price. It's quite obvious that they make a lot of money off of people buying stuff that they thought was lower in price.  As an added bonus, this store must have some of the highest prices in a grocery store anywhere. They put stuff on sale that is still much higher than normal prices at another store.\\n\\nWant to withdraw cash with your ATM card at the register? They offer up to $100 for your convenience. However, if you should actually try to get cash back you will likely find that you will be given all fives and the cashier will be none too happy about it. Question them on why they offer up to $100 dollar ATM withdrawals but don't have sufficient change and are unhappy about you doing so? I have had three completely different answers to this question from three different employees. Including one employee telling me that the problem doesn't exist!\\n\\nWaiting in a long line happens all too frequently because they have no self checkout and only one cashier most of the time.\\n\\nThe reviews here on this store are puzzling, to say the least. Apart from the fact that many online reviews are questionable now because of \\\"reviews\\\" from people with ties to the business, some of the reviews seem to be based on one single visit and or incident. Saying that an employee said \\\"Hi\\\" to you and asked you if you needed help is hardly justification for posting a good review for the store. I know of an employee at this store who was great, but sadly seems to be gone now. Even when she was there it was nowhere near enough to change our overall experience of this store. I have been to this store (as a secondary choice) extensively for years just because it is so close to where we live, but I have had enough. This review is based on a LOT of visits. People are doing consumers a disservice when they post frivolous reviews that are extremely misleading. \\n\\nGive this store the treatment it deserves and stay away."}

Their burgers are very tasty and are available with a huge list of free toppings unlike most places at this level. Get some free peanuts while you're waiting for your order? Yes please. Although I enjoy the burgers, I think the fires are worth equal mention. They come in regular and cajun variety and I've never seen anyone who actually needed to order a large. The regular is plenty, even to share. The menu is pretty basic but they do have a hot dog and a grilled cheese option for those who aren't into burgers.

I also had the sides of garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  My wife had the asparagus and sauteed mushrooms and topped it off with a large salad.  The atmosphere was a cross between romantic and peaceful, which is no small feat when you have a casino right outside your doors.

One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. \\n\\nThe only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes. I'm used to asking for fruit instead, and this is the first time I was charged extra. Wasn't happy about that, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll be back here pretty often."}

I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner\/manager\/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.\\n\\nSecondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.  \\n\\nLastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.\\n\\nSo why one star?  Why bother to give one?

If you're a first time customer like me, be sure to factor in the 100 ml glass bottle costs (3.80 each).

{"label":0,"text":"This review is based strictly off their customer service.\\n\\nMy wife and I were going out for dinner last night at Muramoto.  We arrived early (5:30p) to the King Street area.  So, we thought we would stop by Nat Spil for a couple pre-dinner cocktails.  Neither of us had been there before and were excited to give it a try.\\n\\nOur initial take was we really liked the atmoshere - seemed very cool.  However, as mentioned in other reviews, we soon found that the place was small and a little confusing for us.  The place has about 10 tables that I could see and a small bar with about 12 stools.  Is it a restaurant or a bar?  The reason I bring this up is that when we walked in there were two couples sitting at tables and no one at the bar.  One couple had food and other couple just had cocktails.  There was no one to greet us when we walked in (i didn't think that was going to be a big deal but it obvioulsly was), so we sauntered over to the bar and ordered a cocktail.  After the drinks were poured we thought it might be more comfortable sitting at a table and told the bartendress - \\\"no problem\\\" she says.\\n\\nWe chose a table in the front window area.  It was small but had four sets of silverware.  Suddenly a waiter appears and asks if it just the two of us tonight.  \\\"Yes\\\" I replied.  He lets out a big sigh, and then snatches two of the silverware sets.  As he is walking to the cupboard to put them away I notice that he is shaking his head the whole time and is still visible pissed that there is only two of us.  He then takes the silverware he just cleared and started slamming\/throwing  them back into the cupboard drawers.  \\n\\nLet me take the opportunity to remind you that there were four other customers in this establishment at this point and it was 5:30pm.  It's not like we were occupying prime seats during prime time.  \\n\\nSo... The waiter comes back and says, \\\"what do want for dinner?\\\"  with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.   I said we were just having drinks and wouldn't be staying long.  Another hugh sigh and he storms off to his station and takes a big drink from his wine glass.  I was surprised to see the waiter drinking at 5:30.  I wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establishment's owner?!?\\n\\nWell that pretty much sealed it - not going to have a second drink there.  We slammed our cocktails and high tailed it.  As we were leaving we had to walk right past him.  He never looked up or even acknowledged we were leaving.  \\n\\nInterestingly enough... Around 8:00p as we were walking back to our car from Muramoto, we glanced into the front window of Nat Spil.  It looked they had a whooping crowd of about 6 people.  I wonder how many other people left after dealing with that ass-bag waiter?!?"}

But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food."}

Halfway through the meal the server offered hot sauce, which helped,but I ultimately expect more flavor in the food itself. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nice, and they have patio dining, but I'd give this restaurant a definite pass in the future."}
{"label":3,"text":"Ri Ra's is a good ol' fashioned Irish Pub. The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland, though it's still a lot smaller than your average restaurant.\\n\\nThe food and atmosphere are amazing. They have the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, bar none. Their soda bread, while not traditional, is very good and is a perfect compliment to their OUTSTANDING potato and leek soup. It's the perfect thing to warm your insides on a blustery evening. The burgers are just okay. The decor is great, with the heavy wooden tables and stone fireplaces, it feels like a real, rustic pub.  The prices are a few dollars more than I think is fair, thus the 4-star rating. Be sure to join their rewards club so you can get discounts and gift cards to make it more affordable.\\n\\nOh, and they have live music later in the evening on weekdays."}

Started off the evening in the circular bar at the front with live music - great way to enjoy a cocktail before dinner.  Then we made our way toward the dark, chic, modern yet classic dining room.  The service was impecable and the food was amazing.  Be careful how much you order because the portions are humungous!   I had a blackened salmon that literally melted in my mouth, others enjoyed steak and tuna - both delish!  We made the mistake of ordering two shrimp appetizers - man these things were the size of Chihuahuas!! We also made the mistake of ordering the sweet potato fries and they brought us enough to feed a small army.  Don't get me wrong, the food was spectacular, but man it was a lot of food!"}

The bathrooms weren't anything special at all, kinda blah! No room fridg., I thought those were a given in Vegas rooms... They are building a new pool, which looks like it will be pretty cool, but the guys working on it started their work at 8 am...ugh. Woke me up every morning..."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place was a great place to stay.  They made accommodations when we needed it and we got a tower room for a pretty good deal for two nights.  They have great customer service and the hotel was fun to gamble at.  The only cons I have at this place is the walk to the parking lot.  It is one long ass walk to the parking lot.  I swear I spent all my time doing that walk since we had to make multiples trips to and from the hotel.  Not to mention the hotel is from what I consider to be pretty far away from all the attractions of the strip.  I'm excited about the Criss Angel Cirque Du Soleil show that will start in September and will probably stay here in the future when I need a cheap place to stay"}

I love that it is so reasonably priced yet still close to the strip and they even have a shuttle service!  No brainer there!  One thing I hate is rooms that smell old and musty or when you check-in after a long day of travel and something doesn't work.  I have never encountered any of that here...ever.  The Manager, Pamela, even greeted me and asked me to enjoy my stay.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas for business or pleasure."}

SCORE.  She recommended the enchiladas verde, which was FANTASTIC.  I could slurp their verde sauce with a spoon.\\n\\nPlantains once again instead of rice.  Seriously, they should just forgo the rice and serve fried plantains with every dish.  It could be their signature."}
{"label":2,"text":"This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch."}

The last two times I went, it was incredible how long everything took.  And while it wasn't insanely busy, the staff were literally running around... sometimes carrying full plates!?  Waited about 20 minutes after sitting down to get that \\\"Has anybody helped you yet?\\\", and then it took well over an hour to get any food.  If they would just tell you at the front counter that the wait was over an hour, I'd be fine with that.  Pretty much exact same experience 2 times in a row, but like I said I'm a sucker for a breakfast joint.  Maybe 3rd time is the charm?"}
{"label":3,"text":"Definitely not THE best buffet in Vegas, but I chose this place specifically for its value\\n\\nHaving said that, this buffet is pretty damn good and has A LOT of selections. Crab Legs for days, surprisingly good Asian food (they even have Pho!), and all your other essential Vegas buffet selections (Italian, Mexican, American).\\n\\nThis place is also huge; that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how lazy you are. It stretches pretty far so you may have a long walk back to your table, but at least you're burning some calories at a buffet amirite? Hehe\\n\\nAlso I wish they had more fruit selection as they only had melons and pineapples when I went. Not a deal breaker, but it's always a good idea to fruit it up after all the meat and carbs you're going to be stuffing down.\\n\\nOverall though this place is good for the price. Obviously if you want the full vegas buffet experience, you might want to check out the pricier places on the strip :)\\n\\nHappy Eating!!"}

So the first  time i was there it was packed before a show on Stage AE beers cheap during happy hour.. So we just got beers and drank them outside on the patio. The next night we had another show to go see at Stage AE. Went with other people and got a seat at the bar section. Our waitress Kristen was horrible. You couldnt here her it was like she was in outer space when you talked to her.So we got some apps and beers and left very disapointed. So just last friday i took my mom to the pirate game and thought i would give it one more shot. Bad idea, it was packed but again i was able to find a booth. I got my order right away because i knew happy hour was ending. My mom took about five minutes she came back and took her order. 35 minutes later we still did have her sandwich. I had never cancelled an order and i do not fault the waitress as she checked on it 15-20 min in. But we told her we have to get to the game and got my check and left.

{"label":1,"text":"I have been to this theater many times before, but I must say on my last visit there I was less than impressed. Not that I was over the moon on my previous visits. \\n\\nI was there with my family on a Monday night for an 8:20 showing of Monsters University. We got our tickets and went through the concession walk through\/ self serve, which I honestly think is just silly, why can't they just have the regular concession counter like at the other theaters? The reason I don't like the self serve is because everything is always messy and sticky, which it was! People just let there kids who are too small to reach the soda fountain help themselves to whatever they want and they get soda everywhere! I don't mean to sound like a hard ass, but watch your kids people!!! So of course it doesn't get wiped up in a timely manner and thus everything in that walk thru is pretty gross! \\n\\nMy family enters the theater and you know the build up when you walk in and you wonder how many people are already in there and you wonder if you will get to pick any seat you want or if it will be full already and you will have to sit next to strangers........ you know what I am talking about. \\nSo we walk down the corridor and round the corner, yay my kids get to pick whatever seats they want, blah blah blah..... I can't be excited for them because all I can see is garbage! Yes I said garbage! There was garbage, popcorn, candy boxes, soda cups, under all the seats! I had to turn around and make sure we didn't walk into a movie that was already playing! But in fact we were in the correct theater and that was in fact trash under all the seats! So apparently they don't actually sweep out the trash, instead they just sweep it under the seats?!?! I was freaking out, but I had to do my best to put my OCD away so I didn't ruin the night for my kids. My hubby didn't even have to look at me to know what was going on, he did his best to find the seats with the least trash. \\nThen once the movie started we noticed there was a big scratch down the left side of the movie screen! Seriously, this was not going to be my night! \\n\\nThis was just a lesson learned for my husband and I. We prefer the Aliante movie theater but we chose to go to the Santa Fe because it was closer to our house, we chose poorly! We will make the drive next time!"}

The restaurant is out in the middle of nowhere at what is basically a little tourist trap just outside of Wittman. My inlaws had a coupon so they invited us for a cowboy type lunch. Yes they live in Sun City...so coupons are a way of life there.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very rustic in decor but has big screen tvs all over the place so people can watch the games. There are rows and rows of picnic tables outside and about 20 tables inside. We chose inside because it was chilly outside.  \\n\\nThe menu is beef, beef and more beef with a smidge of chicken and pork. We had some fantastic onion rings. The salads were refreshing but basic. The grownups all had steaks which were slow cooked and tasty. Not the best steak I ever had but pleasantly better than I had expected. My son had a 100% angus burger that was a 12 oz burger. It was enormous and DELICIOUS. The grill was filled with great mesquite wood and it gave all the meats a nice flavor but it really enhanced the burger. \\n\\nThe side dishes were nicely done as well. Two of us had beans which had different types of beans and bacon in it. There was also baked macaroni and cheese which was pretty good. The coleslaw was delicious--with horseradish in it. Yum! The french fries that went with the burger were well seasoned and crispy.\\n\\nThe only thing I really didn't like was the fact that they kept the doors open to the restaurant. It was a chilly day today and I don't like having flies buzzing around my food unless I'm in my own backyard. I'm sure the outdoor seating will be lovely in the spring though when its warmer and sunny. \\n\\nThe service was prompt, courteous and pleasant. The cook came in to check on us about our steaks and he was quite nice as well. While I don't think I would go out of my way to drive this far for a steak, I might consider bringing out of town guests here for its rustic authenticity and the food really was pretty darn good.

Something to remember for future reservations - always check on the restaurants or stores that you want to visit first to see if they're open or still there...  Check-in and out was a breeze (the staff are extra nice). The only room complaint we have is that the water pipes in our room were extremely noisy all night (coming from other rooms as well!) and this was very disturbing and difficult.  Too bad, seems like the glitz is a facade for cutting corners on construction. Too bad.  We did like that the hotel has free and easy parking, although they get you with a high resort fee on top of the room rate (most Marriott Hotels do this - NOT NICE MARRIOTT!).

For instance, There are never enough employees working at one time. I have NEVER seen all the lanes open. For a market district that has a million lanes, it's understandable to have 3-4 closed lanes when it is slow. Fine. The Squirrel  Hill Eagle sees lane closings, often leaving only 2 available (not including self-checkout). Ah, but when you do get to a register you can forget about the happy greeting or any greeting at all. I have been told to hurry up by bad-mouthed cashiers who want to go on break. Thought there are a couple great managers (for those that know Sarah who has been there forever), but the rest are surly, unkempt, mean people. \\n\\nThe stock...what stock? Though their selection on nonperishable is usually fine, you can forget about freshness anywhere but the deli (nice group at the deli). Fish is NOT, I repeat, not fresh. Mold can be found on almost everything in the produce department. I am meat connoisseur and even their top quality beef is a joke (try Fillet Mignon that has the diameter of a silver dollar with heavy marbling).

{"label":2,"text":"Fry's Electronics.  Every time I come here it's hit or miss. This last trip was definitely a miss. Let me explain.\\n\\nI needed ink for my HP printer. All I needed were all four colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Simple enough right? Well apparently the fools.......I meant the guys that work here don't know the difference. The first guy I spoke to pointed me to the Lexmark shelf of ink cartridges. Fail. Next guy I see tells me it was down another aisle and what do I see? Nothing but Canon inkjet cartridges.\\n\\nIt was not until I went towards the HP printers that I found the inkjet cartridges I needed. Thanks for wasting my time guys! I really appreciate it! Gotta love the employee customer service here.\\n\\nSpeaking of employee customer service, I have yet to see an employee here that looks like they really like working here. I for one would not want to work here. Morales seem really low here. Memo to Mr. Fry, if you want to improve employee attitude, I suggest you at least let these guys wear more casual clothing instead of the shirt and tie approach. It's obvious the men I see here are uncomfortable with what they are wearing. These guys can wear t-shirts and jeans for all I care. As long as they take care of the me, the customer.\\n\\nSo as I make my way to the front to pay for the items that I ended up finding myself, I couldn't help but notice the all the knockoff perfumes and colognes they were selling. You know, the kind that has knockoff names and the scent only lasts like 5 minutes. The kind of fake stuff that has people coming out of nowhere to try to sell to you as you are either going or coming from your car at a parking lot of whatever establishment you are patronizing. Why would an electronics store be selling this crap?\\n\\nAs for paying for my items, sometimes the guys that help you find something usually scan the items you plan on purchasing and it produces a document that you take with you to the cashier. This guarantees that sales associate that helped you get some kind of commission on the sale. Of course, I didn't get one from them that day but whenever I do, sometimes I get rid of the document if they give me any kind of attitude in helping me find what im looking for. My thing is, if you are just helping me enough just to get that commission and not genuinely care about me as an individual, then you don't deserve it.\\n\\nLastly, the one marketing ploy that I think was really smart of them is that when you make your way going towards the cashier they have tons of eye candy that you just cannot avoid not seeing. Things like thumb drives, batteries, snacks, drinks, and yes, lots of different candy. On more than one occasion, I end up giving in and get something I did not plan on getting at all. Yup, somebody knew what they were doing in regards to making you spend just a little more money. \\n\\nSo if you find yourself here needing something here, I suggest that you have plenty of time to spare and have some kind of gameplan. Oh, and don't even bother eating over at the caf\\u00e9. I ate there one time because I was so hungry that I couldn't wait to go somewhere after. I ended up getting a turkey bagel sandwich which was ok. I paid like 6 bucks and change for it. Kinda of pricey for a bagel. Don't think it was worth it.\\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #51"}
{"label":2,"text":"I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. \\n\\nOverall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives."}
{"label":0,"text":"The waitress\/owner is the worst I have ever experienced.  Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.\\nI went in with allergies\/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.\\nShe went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  \\nShe came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.\\n\\nI said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, \\\"Everyone is different,\\\" so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.\\n\\nI asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  \\\"Excuse me?\\\" I thought to myself, \\\"Does Orient equate with Chinese?\\\"\\n\\nI asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!\\n\\nFinally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, \\\"Alright already.\\\"  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, \\\"Check please!\\\" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.\\n\\nI waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled \\\"Never again!\\\" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.\\n\\nI had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before."}
{"label":4,"text":"Birthday celebrations should be done up big and Beso definitely fits that description. From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.\\n\\nWe got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.\\n\\nWhen the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.\\n\\nFor entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  \\n\\nThis is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele."}

{"label":2,"text":"i call this 3-star rating an UNLOCK POTENTIAL 3 stars. \\n\\nIn my opinion, i feel like this place has the potential to be one of the most AWESOMEST fun nightclub on the strip.\\n\\nThis club opened during new yrs and the past weekend was my first time in attending this new venue. I'll simply list the pros and cons that i noticed in this super nightclub. \\n\\nPros. \\n1. The venue and crowd is BEAUTIFUL. mix crowd. hip hop floor and main dance floor.\\n\\n2. Contrary to the previous reviews i've read, the staff is beyond friendly and seem to be willing to bend over their backs for everyone in having a good time here.\\n \\n3. Didn't get any drinks here, but from little chit-chats in the smokin hot ass bartenders. a red bull vodka is only $15. very very cheap compared to Surrender's $19 house vodka w\/ red bull.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Will probably never happen, but they really need to get rid of the stairs and replace them w\/ escalators. This is a huge design flaw for the managing partners of marquee. Unlike Playboy Club to Moon, there are no simple escalators up to a club. It kinda gets rid of the \\\"baller\\\" feeling when u climb stairs from venue to venue compared to an escalator where the music crescendos as u rise to the club. \\n\\n2. Elevators won't go down till 1:30am so everyone has to climb 3-5 flights of stairs down to exit in the Cosmo's pool area if they want to go back to their rooms for sexy-time or pre-party. (BEWARE: as you exit,  WATCH ur step... there's a ledge where girls especially are vulnerable in tripping on if they wear high heels)\\n\\n3. The main dance floor is a tad too small for my tastes. Also it has more of a rave-like vibe to it where everyone stares at the DJ and throws their arm to the sky like zombies. I don't blame the crowd for doing this considering there's a 30+ft of LCD awesomeness in the back of the DJ to look at. EVEN SO, this type of set-up negates a nightclub feel to the venue.   \\n\\n\\nALL IN ALL, a very nice nightclub w\/ very friendly staff and crowd. everyone is just here to have a ballin good time. \\n\\nI say, give this place a couple months to workout their flaws and it'll be the next best thing vegas nightlife will see in the years to come."}

They do an amazing job on my nails every time but there customers service is awful unless your dropping at least $100 or more on service. If they're busy and you have a simple service there is no small talk (maybe with the neighboring nail tech) but they want you in and out. And if you ask for specifics like can you paint this nail orange and this one pink or something of that nature and they're running pass there allotted work time be prepared for lots of sighing and talking under ones breath. God forbid you nick a nail they'll be way to busy too correct it or make you feel foolish for nicking your nail. Oh someone else will fix it though they do pride themselves on how the nails look but not on the personable side of the transaction the girls at the front are super sweet and love to see everyone's nails.

I ordered an ice tea when we first sat down and everyone received their drink but me so I flagged down a passing waitress and requested my drink again.  And then about 20 minutes after that our main waitress bought out my drink order not realizing I had already requested another one and received it.    \\n\\nWhat I did like about this place is the atmosphere.

I like big manly breakfasts and this sounded perfect!  Two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs cooked to order in the middle with cheese on top.  Yum!  That really sounded delicious to me, unfortunately it was a big heaping pile of FAIL slopped on a plate.  The bacon was about the only good part of my meal.  The cheese tasted like plastic, the eggs were rubbery, and the hash browns were so greasy that they slicked my lips with oil after every bite.  In the end, despite the fact that I only ate about 1\/3 of my food, I got sick.  I was not a happy camper and I will never come back."}
{"label":3,"text":"If there's something I developed a taste for over the last couple of years, it is definitely French cuisine. My girlfriend loves everything French, especially the food. I decided to take her here for our two year anniversary and I can't say that my expectations weren't met. The menu isn't a run-on book, it's a one page array of all things tasty. Les Poissons (hee hee hee, hah hah hah) looked and smelled fantastic. The wine was affordable per glass. We ordered the \\\"Frangria,\\\" the French version of Sangria which was quite the punch.\\n\\nI have this weird sense of things where I judge a place I eat by what they give you for free, in this case the bread. Naturally, we sat down and were greeted with a French baguette accompanied by some delicious butter and an amuse bouche, which was some kind of pickled apple concoction. The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said \\\"I could just come here for the bread\\\" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\\n\\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise. My beef wellington was.....nucking futs delicious. I've always wanted to try a wellington and oh my gosh was it delicious. The beef was tender and succulent, cooked just the way I like it. The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a saut\\u00e9ed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \\n\\nTo make matters \\\"worse,\\\" we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert. Gluttony became our ruler at this point as we shoveled this behemoth of a dessert down our bellies completely satisfied with the meal as a whole. My only gripe was that our waitress was a little inattentive once we got our food. As we didn't see her from the moment we got our food till we were done, looking around for her to come by. Regardless, that would not be the deciding factor if I come back because I definitely will. \\n\\nGentleman, if you have a date and you want to impress her, go on and take her here. We sat inside but I hear the patio is just as nice. This is a great place for tourists and LOCALS alike."}

They happily printed off 20 sheets, one-sided, black and white and then another 20 sheets black-and-white double-sided, at the grand total of \\u00a36.

{"label":0,"text":"I had high expectations for the Palazzo the so called 5 start hotel, but recently during a recent stay my hotel room was burglarized by one of the hotel employees.  While I was gone they took one of my suitcases and filled it will as much stuff as they could taking everything from a computer, to shorts, to shoes, to a razor.  To add to this bad experience the Palazzo security was terrible.  They took my statement, but wouldn't give me an incident number or any information on the incident and in addition didn't give me any information on the investigation process.  They just handed me a business card and said call this number on Monday or Tuesday.  For the money paid to stay here I expect more from them from a security and customer service perspective.  My money is better spent on a place where the security guards actually work.  I WILL NOT STAY HERE EVER AGAIN!  MY ADVICE TO YOU - WATCH ALL YOUR STUFF, INCLUDING YOUR SHOES, OR DON'T STAY HERE!"}
{"label":1,"text":"Good for a dessert place, bad for food.  \\n\\nCame here on a Sunday for brunch super hungry.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated and ended up sitting outside on the patio in 106 degree heat.  While they have fans with water misters, they don't reach certain tables.  I had to ask the hostess to move to a better table where we would get at least some mist.  The outside patio is covered by a pink tarp which gave everything a bright pink glare.  Bring sunglasses!\\n\\nWe were starving by the time we were seated.  We waited 5 minutes for a server to take our drink order.  By this time we already knew what we wanted to order so we placed our order.  I got an LEO omelet and the main squeeze ordered a  burger.   It took 10 minutes for us to get our water and another 10 minutes to get our food.   My omelet was all egg and hardly any onions and salmon.  It tasted dry and salty.  The burger was okay.  It seemed like forever until we found the waitress to ask for our check.  We ordered a cookies and cream milkshake to go. That came back 5 minutes later along with our check.  \\n\\nMy experience here was pretty bad.  I feel like it was a waste of time and energy sitting around waiting, waiting, and waiting for food that wasn't even good.  The best part of the whole experience was the milkshake--it was delicious."}
{"label":2,"text":"Just returned from spending 4 nights at this JW. I would have loved to give them 4.5 stars but we ran into some issues that after booking the suite months and months in advance should not happen especially knowing how other JWs function as my preferred hotel choice.\\n\\nWhen we arrived and checked into our room  there were construction workers just outside   Cutting wood, etc. so the noise was rediculous. When we called the front desk and asked why haven't anyone told us at time of checking- in time they had no answer. Turns out it will go on for two days untold the weekend. They offered to look at another suite that is right next door of course silly as the noise level was the same. We requested speaking with the manager who ended up putting some credit on the account but considering how much you spend each night this is a drop in the bucket. In addition as this is a one bedroom suite with dinning and living area as well as wet bar\/ kitchen area there were absolutely no glasses or flat ware so asked the manager to send it over. At this time we wasted two hours and were late for our restaurant reservation.\\n\\nSince we bought some water bottles and fruit ahead of time and had a fridge in the room we stacked it up before leaving only to find out when we returned that the fridge is barley working\/keeping things cold. So needed to make another call to have the fridge replaced the next morning. Again when you spend thousands over a long weekend getaway you should not be dealing with this hassle.\\n\\nPremises- loved the location of this suite room 558 as very private. The fact that tennis courts are on premises is fantastic and we took advantage each morning. The fella who oversees the court was very nice until the last day he was very rude and cranky not sure if he woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day but certainly no reason to take it out on clients.\\n\\nRoom service- though our package included bfast in their restaurant we ordered in as had dinning room table and much more relaxing and peaceful- food was fantastic, very fresh and the delivery guys professional.\\n\\nSpa- very nice facilities though I was shocked to see signing in and out for a robe and plastic flip flops- I use spas all over the world and have never seen this- perhaps they have bad experience with people steeling but giving the fact you spend 600 on treatments in the afternoon I don't think I would be after plastic flip flops. My massage was fantastic Linda who has been there for 17 years was very nice and knowledgeable. My honey oatmeal body wrap experience wasn't as good- the therapist lady was so unhappy which was obvious from her non inviting manners that made me feel very awkward throughout my treatment. The entire idea of going to a spa is to relax not to feel bad as someone who doesn't like their job makes things uncomfortable for the client.\\n\\nWe will most likely return or will go to the Four Seasons down the road. Like I said I love JWs but the management here has some work to do to bring this location up to its legacy."}
{"label":3,"text":"#30DaysOfYelp: 22\/30\\n\\nWish I had a glass topped Yamaha grand with a fancy tv screen down the side! No wonder it's called The Million Dollar Piano...\\n\\nGo see this show! I play some piano so I think Elton John's pretty cool, but I'm not such a huge fan that I'd buy tickets see him at home. Glad I did in Vegas though! I saw this with some family, and I was blown away by his personality, enthusiasm, the lights\/video, and his band! We sat on the 2nd mezzanine (almost nosebleeds) but on the left side, so we had a great view of him playing. He played a solid 2 hours of hits, and it was so great to watch everyone together, especially that percussionist in the back. I was a percussionist in school so it was awesome to see an expert's skills. Best way to play a tambourine is with a fancy dance & flourish!\\n\\nAs with all concerts, there are always some people in the audience who like it WAY too much. One lady, who was a couple rows below was dancing the whole 2 hours, her hands waving in the air, blocking the view. I don't mind people enjoying music & having a blast, but respect people around you, woman! They paid for their tickets too! I thought it was funny though, when Elton played \\\"Circle of Life\\\" she sat down & stopped wriggling altogether. She didn't even clap at the end of the song. She must really hate The Lion King! What's up with that?\\n\\nIf you can get floor seats near the front, do it. At the end, some audience members went up on stage & gathered around the piano for the last song. Elton was whisked away really quickly though...I guess he would be swarmed if he stayed, heh. Must be nice to have bodyguards."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not quite sure what all of the fuss is about with the Wynn Encore. The view from the 32nd floor was of the distant mountains, yes, but also of a Ross and some construction. Woo hoo. So yes, be sure to ask for a view of the strip, not the Ross!!\\n\\nThe decor is not my taste. Can you say gaudy!?? Gigantic butterflies tramp stamp the carpets and the chandeliers in the casino dangle ominously overhead  like giant red tarantulas waiting for their prey.  If you are a flaming homosexual male and listen to Cher this might be right up your alley but somehow the whole thing seemed ridiculous to me. All that money and you put freaken butterflies on the carpet?!  And the drapes? Oh no honey, the drapes do not match the carpet!\\n\\nThe room was ok. Everyone else was thrilled with it. I thought the furniture looked like it was covered in shellac- so what if you have remote control drapes?  The decor reminded me of the apartment that Ray Liota's girlfriend had in Goodfellas.

The woman who gave me the card said I would get emails and text messages and up to 200 points just for signing up. None of that happened but at least they keep the drinks coming...for the most part.\\n\\nThe Wynn Encore did a decent job outfitting their cocktail waitresses in beaded skimpy dresses, (which also look cheap up close) but um HELLO where is the man candy?!!!!

My fifty dollar 8oz petite filet was something I could have gotten Outback except outback may have cooked it to order.\\nNo thanks Wynn.\\n\\n I'll keep shopping around for my favorite Las Vegas hotel.

I didn't try any of the breakfast plate but to my eye the eggs seemed to have been cooked in a large batch in a steamer. The turkey sausage and potatoes didn't appear to be a fresh kind and had that certain frozen look to them like what you can find in your grocers freezer. You can see in my photo they look very processed.\\n\\nI go to try the little cake and have a taste of the frosting. Wow! it was terribly sweet and have a texture that was like liquid rubber with an awful after taste. So I peal some off and go for the inside. The cake tasted like something processed and a chemical fake raspberry taste was above it. I fear it had it had castoreum in it. If you don't know what castoreum is you possibly don't want to know what it is but you HAVE eaten some if you ever ate a Cadbury Cream Egg.\\n\\nA few things did look better than the breakfast like the tomato and cheese salad and the gravlax plates. \\n\\nIf you are a fan of the meatballs you can buy them in the store in the frozen section.\\n\\nI think most people have had food outside the box and have had better.\\n\\n1.5 Stars"}

{"label":1,"text":"I'm weary from traveling to an overrated Madison destination.\\n\\nI had heard of Weary Traveler through Yelp and wanted to go to a cool hangout for my birthday since a few friends were in town.  I don't get to Willy St. very often so I figured it was a good reason to try a fun spot.  I have to say, I was unimpressed.  \\n\\nWe were traveling in a group of seven, and we showed up after 8pm on a Saturday.  I fully was expecting a crowded scene and it lived up to expectations.  Unfortunately, two six-person groups had arrived just before us so we were in for an hour wait.  Not the most terrible thing in the world because it was a chance to drink and catch up with each other at the bar.  Good selection of beer and the service was attentive, as long as you don't mind being served by a rude bartender.  Granted, it was busy, but we were quite pleasant to her and she still threw our change back without so much as a 'thank you.'  \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated at a nice corner circular booth, we did have a good waitress who was very cool.  I ordered Bob's Bad Breath Burger, which was pretty tasty, though while it said 'grass-fed,' it did seem like the patty was the pre-made frozen kind.  I wasn't overly blown away.  My friend's ordered the Carne Asada that looked ok, if you like a few cut pieces of steak over a bed of tortilla chips with some pico de gallo.  Again, didn't really blow my socks off.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, it's LOUD.  They certainly pack a lot of tables into the two sides of the restaurant and waiters and waitresses are always squeezing behind you at the bar and between the close tables.  The old-school decor, however, is dark, warm and inviting, which I thought was a plus.\\n\\nMake no mistake:  Weary Traveler is a place to be seen.  The locale on the Willy St. corner is great and there is a reason it is so busy.  The prices seemed reasonable, though I don't think I'll be itching to go back anytime soon."}

I knew nothing about it before we went. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the new spring training complex behind the theaters was not built to include parking for fans, so the Pavillions parking lot also doubled as a baseball parking lot, and it was packed the night we went. There were parking attendants stopping cars heading towards the theaters, trying to charge $5 for parking. When I explained that we were just going to the movies, I got a puzzled look, but he let me through without paying. \\n\\nI don't remember the exact ticket prices, but it was $26.50 for two adults and one child, which seemed about normal for a non-matinee movie. We then went to the concession stand and ordered a small bag of popcorn, two pretzels and two drinks, which totaled $27. A bit on the steep side for my liking, but whatcha gonna do? \\n\\nThe pretzels were frozen and needed to be cooked, so the clerk offered to bring them to us in the theater, which was a first and a very nice surprise. He was very friendly and helpful, and bringing us the pretzels just proved the point. \\n\\nThe theater was very clean, and I really like the renovations they made. I LOVE stadium seating, but the 3-D movies I can do without. My daughter seemed to enjoy it though, so I guess there is a market. \\n\\nAll in all it was a decent experience. I didn't have any of the problems some of the other reviewers had, but I did think that spending over $50 for a movie and basic snacks was a bit extreme. \\n\\nI also tried the demo of the moving theater seats, and I will definitely be avoiding those theaters.

The breaded Chicken fingers just tasted oily, same with the fish and chips.\\n\\nBottom line for me on this place: come to drink and hanging out, but go get some food else where.\\n\\nTIP:  Bartenders at the Big bar validate parking for the parking garage."}

{"label":4,"text":"Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \\n\\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\\n\\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\\n\\nLastly, his office is called \\\"Reel Dental\\\" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\\n\\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"}

I have to admit, I have gone to this shop before and it was just fine, but this one time, no. There was a sign at the door which said 40% off one men's item, not specification on anything else. (for father's day) So I went and picked up a shirt and proceeded to pay. I waited and then when it was my turn walked up. Then I was told that the item I picked is not included in the promo being it is new. I then said that I didn't want it. The cashier then said something, not sure if to the person next to her or to her headset, and then said they will honor it. During the whole transaction the person made no eye contact, when she talked I didn't know if it was to me or to the headset. No greeting, no thank you nothing. I was the one who said thank. It looked like they were doing ME a favor by selling me the shirt!!!\\nTSA agents are more friendly and courteous."}

Some my favourite cupcakes include: the classic, the lemon, and the coconut. As far as cookies go I lean towards the dark chocolate walnut and the snickerdoodle. \\n\\nThey are a little pricey for some people but once you take the first bite you will know why. \\n\\nIf you like them on Facebook they frequently post the \\\"word of the day\\\" for half off treats.

{"label":2,"text":"I've heard alot about Round Table from Californians.  At first I was shocked that they charged $20 for a large pizza which would feed about 3 people.  For less, you can go to Dom Demarco's or Grimaldi's.\\n\\nBut I have to say that the Chicken and Garlic was quite tasty.  The creamy garlic sauce is really addicting.  I think it would be awesome if you get a side on the side to dip your pizza in - kind of like Papa John's.\\n\\nWhat I like is that the crust on the bottom is crisp and the body of the crust has the nice chewy texture.  The crust experience was quite unique for a chain.  The leftovers were even better the next day.   My method is to nuke it for 30-40 seconds and finish it off on a cast iron.  It provides the same experience you have when eating there.\\n\\nI'll be back for their Mon-Sat lunch buffet.  Without the use of a groupon, I don't know if i would go back outside of the buffet especially when I believe you can get much better value and experience at Grimaldi's or Dom Demarco's.\\n\\nBut the pizza here was still really good.  3.5 stars."}
{"label":3,"text":"This is one of the better Barnes and Noble locations in town, not to mention the closest to this reviewer's house. And unlike that one on Rainbow, this one DOES have a video section.\\n\\nBarnes and Noble carries all things books. Be it reference, works of fiction, periodicals, there is a little bit of everything here. Any subject you could possibly want a book on, there is a good bet you'll find something in here. \\n\\nThe video section is top-notch selection-wise, but their prices are considerably higher than big box stores. They make up for this with a good selection of obscure titles, but you might just want to go to Zia for that stuff. Still, every now and then they DO have good sales in this department.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is a small section featuring board games and the like, basically things that can make good gifts. A Starbucks Coffee location is featured here as well, complete with outdoor patio area.\\n\\nTo be honest, I haven't had to ask the employees for much in here. But when I do have a question, they are generally attentive and help me quickly. I haven't had a problem with any member of their staff, ever. \\n\\nThe major complaint I have with the store is that they move stuff around every few months. The way I see it, if the store layout ain't broken, don't fix it! This makes it a huge hassle to find what you're looking for if they have just done a renovation. Additionally, their frequent buyer program must be paid for, whereas the one at Borders is free. \\n\\nAll in all this is a top-notch bookstore, I just wish they had better prices on their (not on sale) movies and that they wouldn't move stuff around so often. The store gets a firm recommendation though."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not so impressed. First off, it smelled sorta funky in there.\\n\\nI ordered a monterey chicken sandwich. The avocado tasted like the guacamole spread you buy at the store, not like fresh guacamole. The fries were ok, they do give you a lot though.\\n\\nThree of my friends ordered the chicken pot pie. I'm not quite sure that is an accurate description of it. It was more like thick soup with two big pieces of puff pastry on the side. I didn't taste it, but they all seemed to like it.\\n\\nNow, I never thought I'd be disappointed by a brownie, but I was and so were all my friends. For $7 we got a not so good brownie that tasted like it was from a box and got thrown in the microwave for a few seconds and topped with ice cream. We (5 young women) did not even finish it!  \\n\\nOur server and her assistant were sorta awkward, maybe they were new. At the beginning of service, my friend asked to have our checks separate and I said I had a groupon, She said it wasn't a problem. At the end, the owner came and gave us a talking to because he said it was groupon's policy that they aren't allowed to have separate checks, but he was gonna go ahead and accept it this time. WTH!? I really don't see the big deal... Good thing we had that groupon because it paid for that total disappointing dessert. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I had expected better and was excited to try this place, but I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"label":2,"text":"With all the rave reviews I have read about Big Boys, I was expecting great results! Maybe I expected too much out of this small pizza joint. We ordered a 16'' pizza, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders for dinner to be delivered to our house. People mostly compliment the place's large single slices, and maybe for the price that would've been a better option for lunch time. But for dinner and a full pizza for the price, it wasn't anything to write home about.\\n\\nDelivery: 5\/5 Pretty standard delivery times. We ordered around 8PM on a Sunday night, and received our food at around 8:30 or 8:45. The ease of online ordering was great, also!\\n\\nPizza: 3\/5 Okay pizza. Tasted more 'home-made' than the big-brand counter-parts like Pizza Hut or Domino's. Pretty decent amount of cheese, and the pepperoni used was good. Nothing really 'special' though.\\n\\nMozzarella sticks: 2\/5 It's pretty hard to mess up mozzarella sticks, but these for some reason just tasted... off. Maybe it was the oil used to fry them, or maybe the flour\/breading used. Just didn't taste 100% to me.\\n\\nChicken Tenders: 3\/5 Same complaint as above, really. They had a weird after taste, either attributed to the fryer oil or breading. The chicken itself seemed like a pretty decent portion for the price. \\n\\nAll in all, I probably WOULDN'T order another full pizza from this place again. I may try out some of their other options, like the fries or garlic knots and only order a slice of pizza, as others have done."}
{"label":2,"text":"The place is really cute and has a really nice outdoor area to include a bar. Went for lunch and sat outside on the artificial turf.  The lights strung up outside I'm sure will provide great atmosphere at night. The food was good, but noting spectacular. I had a garden salad and the other people in my group had a chicken panini sandwich in which the chicken was dry and a strawberry salad where the strawberries were mushy. I could look past all of that, but the thing that got me is how slooooowwww the service is. We ordered fairly quickly and the it took forever for the food to come out.

{"label":2,"text":"From one star to three stars in 48 hours.  For the past several months I was having slow internet connections and more recently intermittent service in the early morning.  I was getting increasing agitated with total internet loss for 48 hours.  Far worse (well almost)  than missing my morning tall drip at Starbucks...\\n\\nUpon calling Cox from a friend's phone two miles away I was further agitated by the \\\"customer rep\\\" who wanted me to do the usual routine of disconnecting the modem and router and starting over.  Dah, what planet was the CR  from?  Then all of a sudden I was transferred to another CR who at least understood I couldn't be in two places at once.  This CR checked my connection and there was none.  The CR next checked my modem which was 7 years old and commented they usually last 3 to 5 years.  I had dropped the in-home service two years ago but the CR was able to add it (great joy) so the home service would be \\\"free\\\" except for the new monthly fee.\\n\\nI had to wait to get scheduled to a Sunday morning.  On Sunday morning the internet came back without doing anything.  Again, great joy, so I was assuming Cox had messed up for two days and had corrected the problem remotely.  Did I mention on the original call my neighbor had put her service on vacation and we share the same hub?  I mentioned that to the CRs but they didn't think that was the problem.\\n\\nThe good news and hence this review was the professionalism of Alberto who arrived early and could see I had a weak signal that could be connections or a failing modem.  Alberto cut and replaced the outside connections and looked at my add on gold plated Radio Shack splitter for the TV that I had installed.  Apparently a no, no or at least not a good idea.  He re-wired the outlet and checked my modem.  He said it was working OK but I should consider replacing it.  I went ahead and replaced the modem and all my internet connections are now fast like they should be.\\n\\nAlberto gets 5 stars for his understanding of the situation and detective work.  The CRs get 3 stars for at least making an attempt and Cox gets 1 star for jacking up my basic TV package rate.  Did I mention I got Cox for internet seven years ago and TV was added on for $1 per month.  That gradually shifted to $9.95 and now $21.95.  However, little does Cox realize that if I get a new HD TV with built in tuner and it works over the airways then Cox will lose the TV revenue... Don't tell them so I can break the news..."}
{"label":2,"text":"Went to Iruna last wknd for reverse happy hour on a Saturday. It was my birthday, so i had a little over a dozen ppl with me.  This was our second stop and the intent was to try a new place, score some hh-priced drinks and maybe grab a bite if anyone was hungry. Mission accomplished!  I really dug the place. I like the modern and open feel to the restaurant and bar. It was just before 11 and there were no tables open for my large group, but that was fine since we were mostly drinking anyways. The bartender was cool and made us drinks as fast as we could order em. The Pomegranate Martini was da bomb! So good i had 2! Some friends ordered food and they said it was good, but i only tasted the potatoes (yummy). I was too busy being the birthday girl to eat. =)  Chatted up some ladies at the bar who ended up being off-duty servers at Iruna. They encouraged me to come back for dinner, which i expressed a desire to do, and even bought me a shot!  Once i get back here for dinner, i look forward to updating with more food details and awarding another star!"}

The attention to simplicity and great ingredients is stunning. Super fine Italian flour, real moz, and a wood fired oven create wonderful pies with magnificent leoparding (tiny blackened spots on the crust). The staff, and owner Rick, are super friendly and know how to turn out exceptional pizzas with crisp light crust.

I pass up the closer Filly B's to go here. Not anymore.\\n\\nIn the last 6 months it has REALLY gone downhill in quality, and service isn't too far behind. Tonight we, again, wasted over $35 on food that was un-edible. Of all we ordered, 1 shrimp burrito was *almost* finished out of hunger. The other shrimp burrito was beyond the normal heat that accompanies it. It was SO flaming, spicy hot it was un edible. It burns just thinking about it today, and I like a bit of heat normally. Even my husband who loves HOT said it was too hot.\\n\\nThe super nachos were ruined by horrible tasting beans...they were very old, \\\"antiseptic\\\" tasting and bitter. The dark brown, over fried and many burnt chips didn't help. The nachos were trashed.\\n\\nWorst of everything was the 2 orders of menudo. The meat was disgusting- over cooked, slimy, fatty pieces of nasty, cheap meat- there was no honeycomb tripe barely at all. I wouldn't even feed it to my begging dogs. It was like having a mouthful of hot slime, I had to spit out. It was gag worthy. (3 weeks ago it was delicious- tender but firm, a good blend of mostly honeycomb\/lining )  The last 2 weeks we've ordered the menudo its been wasted. It didn't even taste like it had been cleaned well. Perhaps they were serving reheated menudo from last week- who knows.. Even the lemons tonight were slimy, broken down & squished...rotten in spots where they were brown.\\n\\nI can't begin to tell you how many times its been bad and food has been wasted in the last 6 months. I'm finally at my wits end...we've probably wasted close to $200+ in food in the last several months- 70$ in the last month alone. I keep going back thinking its a fluke because it simply happens on occasion-but not anymore. I'm tired of my hard earned money being poured into a restaurant that no longer cares about quality."}
{"label":1,"text":"I don't mind spending money for a special occasion meal providing the food and the service are commensurate with a high-ticket entr\\u00e9e.  (about $40 per entr\\u00e9e.)\\n\\nWe arrived at 8:30pm and there barely was a wait.  The greeter was courteous.  When we first sat down, they promptly took our cocktail order and told us that water and bread would follow.  \\n\\nThe good:  I had just ordered the same cocktail for dinner the night before at the Voo Doo Lounge.  The one at the other place was nothing to write home about, even though it was the same exact cocktail.  I don't know what they did differently, but the one I had here was truly spectacular.  I'd give it a 10.  I ordered a dirty martini using Grey Goose vodka.\\n\\nThe place was nicely decorated, on the main traffic isle to the concert arena (good for people watching), and was clean.\\n\\nThe bad:  They came around with bread, and you get just one piece of bread, the size of a garlic knot (not very big).  One of my dinner companions was very hungry and after asking, they finally came around with a plate full of bread, but the visual just served just as a tease.  She thought he was just gonna leave the whole plate.  Instead, he gave her just one, and moved on to other tables to pass out the other rolls and acted like it was the last bread on earth and he could only spare just one.\\n\\nThe wait for dinner was very long.  I didn't time it but I'm gonna guess to say it was 45 minutes.  I realize the kitchen might be backed up or something, but our waiter never came by to say he knew we were alive and we were up in 2 more tables (or whatever).  There was plenty of staff, in fact, they told us they were fully staffed that night gearing up for the exiting crowd (not until 11pm) from that night's AC\/DC concert.  We were there during a non-busy time, as the restaurant was only about 75% to capacity and virtually no wait.\\nFor a $40 entr\\u00e9e, I want my waiter to be on top of things and attentive.  Not only did we have a waiter, but we had a waiter's helper\/busboy who came by with water refills and the like.  There really was no excuse I could think of to ignore us that long.\\n\\nI had heard that the food here was so amazing that I simply couldn't wait to try it.  I ordered the Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish.  It was overcooked, very dry, and there was nothing special about it.  To me, the mark of good food is food combinations, seasoning, and the sauce.  Anyone can make fish, chicken, and steak.  It's what you pair it with and the sauce that floats my boat.  Anyway, there were no such good comments I could make.  There was no sauce or special flavors and the food pairings were nothing unusual.  How about you put together some Cajun seasonings or regional Louisiana cooking, for Pete's Sake?  I felt like I could have had the same fish for $10 at a local diner.  It was plain Jane and dried out.\\n\\nIt came with Coucous.  The coucous was very good, but hey, it's coucous.  Who can get excited about coucous?  It's like saying you got excited about rice.\\n\\nThe vegetable was asparagus.  I guess they put it on the grill as well.  It was so overdone that it brought back scary memories of my mom's generation when they used to boil vegetables to death.  It was completely wilted and also had no flavor or distinctive seasoning.  If you're gonna wilt it, then use some spices to rev up our palates.  If you're gonna make it plain, then serve it somewhat al dente so we can at least get in all our nutrients.\\n\\nI ordered the Beignets.  The last time I was in New Orleans, I am ashamed to admit, I bypassed breakfast and instead ate beignets every day for breakfast along with my robust French coffee.  Those beignets made a lifetime lasting impression on me.  While La Gasse's beignets were edible, they weren't light and fluffy and were certainly forgettable.\\n\\nI'm giving the restaurant a poor score for non-existent service (when they clearly weren't busy) and a meal that was no better than Denny's.\\nDT"}

Eventually she goes to get his attention that I am waiting at check out, so the associate arrives looks at my girlfriend and I and helps another person first who just walked up to the counter that moment!  Rude people didn't even concede the first place position to us even though everyone saw us standing there. I said screw this even though you aren't supposed to take electronics products out of the area I started walking to be checked out by a less rude employee.  As I'm starting to leave the girl who I originally approached to ask for help offers to ring up our order after she sees that the other associate turned his back to us.  Then as we're about to exit the building two employees are locking one of the entrances up for the night shift. Right as we're about to walk out they close the doors and tell is to go the other way even though we saw the doors were still open as we were approaching. After some negotiation the door was opened and I left to get as far away as I could from that forsaken building of shameful service. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had and I know customer service I was a food server for 3 years."}

They have tons of crap but they have the dancing monkey lots of pets and of course just seeing the people is pure entertainment. They also have BBQ-some of the best meat on a stick around and of course awesome BBQ chicken. At this place if you ask around you can find anything you want. AND if you wanna sell something just show up at 4-5 am on FRI,SAT,SUN and you just pay $30-$35 to have a spot, they are marked off inside the swapmeet. Set up your table or whatever and sell all day long, they still use the honor system to pay your taxes when you leave. Cost $1 to get in."}

The sourdough bread is yummy and the chips are homemade, but nothing to be excited about. The crab special is a MUST!!! I love that the crabs come already cut and mess free AND it's only $28 for 1 and a half pounds of deliciousness. \\n\\nOysters Rockefeller was yummy, but I prefer the Louisiana gold seal oysters (raw)  Next time we visit we are ordering the cioppino (the guy next to us ordered and it smelled amazing!!!) Overall a good price for the food. Service was meh, but our bartender made sure he checked up on us all the time. Kitchen staff seemed off getting the food out. All our food (appetizer included) came out at the same time.  The Bloody Mary oyster shooter was ok. Too much vodka for my taste.  The best part is that this place is open til 12am!!! That's awesome.

So we got in and the waitress welcomed us and turned on the TV, lots of Turkish music for some reason... Oh and those lights that you find in a club, it was really awful for that peaceful atmosphere.\\n\\nThe waitress was really nice and polite, we didn't needed any explanation with the menu since it was nicely explained and plus I understand most of the language. I ordered the Potato Variniki (basically boiled ravioli with potato stuffing) and they were half empty, guessed they leaked out. But the ones we did get, they were pretty bland but nothing s&p won't fix. Also my side salad for the entree got first to our table, before the app. Our fries (which were also sides to our entrees) also arrived before the main dish. I had the Shish Kabob, chopped pieces of lamb on a giant skewer, which was ridiculouslly huge and looked dangerous, It tasted pretty okay, I got 10 pieces total and it was $15.99... The husband had a lamb sandwich, which was loaded with the same lamb meat, tomatoes, lettuce and lots of tzatziki and it was only $4.99... So I guess I screwed up there :D oh and they too...\\n\\nIced tea with no ice...

{"label":0,"text":"Horrible.  I have come here three times and each experience got progressively worse. \\n\\nThe first time  I came based on the positive reviews.  I ordered 3 rolls.  Service was.. odd.  They brought out 1 roll at a time.  In the meantime, I was starving like crazy and quite annoyed that each time I finished one roll, I still sat there waiting for my next, and next.  I was pretty disappointed by the rolls too (can't remember which I ordered) but their saving grace was the Volcano roll which came last.  \\n\\nThis volcano roll has had me come back 3 more times (only take out, because I didn't feel like dealing with their service again).  The first time I took out, I ordered two volcano rolls.  They were thrown together, all meshed up, never mind the presentation.  Sushi is all about presentation.  Oh well, it tasted great anyway. \\n\\nThe second take out, my husband and I ordered the same volcano roll x 2.  My husband wasn't so blown away and said, \\\"That was not worth $25.00\\\" (Have I mentioned that the roll is some $11.00??  I can go to a fancy sushi restaurant for that kind of price).  The rolls were sort of dry and thrown together with holes inside.  I chalked it up to them not caring about their take outs.  We agreed, we wouldn't come back \\n\\nFF to tonight.  I was starving for sushi and I didn't want to deal with walking into the W in my PJ's, soooo.. I re-yelped Dozo and let all of these positive reviews sway me.  I ordered a volcano (Shrimp tempura with spicy tuna) and a red dragon (crab with spicy tuna).  Horrible.  \\nAgain, holes inside the sushi, and you would laugh if you saw how much shrimp was inside the sushi.  Instead, they filled with a ton of hard, dry, tempura (the breadcrumbs).  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  \\nThe crab (a $12.00 roll) was so dry and fried that the meat had turned brown.  It's like they pre-fried and then threw it in the microwave.  Many of the pieces would fall apart as soon as you tried to pick it up, it's so dry.  The only thing they got right this time : the presentation.  I didn't even recognize the volcano roll this time - I don't think thats what I ended up getting.  \\n$26.00 for two rolls after tax for pick up - I will.never.come.back and I don't understand these reviews.  \\n\\nI haven't posted a review in a couple of years but after poking holes into that sushi roll to remove all those rocks of tempura, it's the first thing I did."}

The food is always excellent - never a complaint from me. I have to say that in all the years I've been eating at RR (in Massachusetts and the last 2 years in Surprise) I cannot understand why the prices keep increasing and the portions seem to be dwindling. Probably the most obvious is this silly \\\"Gladiator Cuff) that they just started using for the fries... it hold about 15 fries and is a perfect way to make it so that you get less.\\n\\nThe Surprise location seems to have an incredible employee turn-over. When we live in MA, we had the same server for almost 1-year. Here in Surprise, we have had a different server every time we've gone. The service struggles desperately at the Surprise location. We always visit with 7-8 people in our party, and that in-itself is an undertaking for any server, I know. But I'm constantly amazed at how many times we have to ask for refills, or ask for more baskets of fries, or long waits for shakes, or long waits for napkins. Two months ago, our server was so bad that I had to complain to the manager that we had been seated for 45 mins and hadn't received our meals - he then took on the role of our server.\\n\\nIt really is kind of sad when we all say \\\"Let's go to Red Robin\\\" and the conversation then goes into the bad service experiences we've had in the past 2-years. I hope they get a handle on this because we really are loyal customers."}

At least the Marine barber cut it evenly all around.  \\n\\nThe barber took two phone calls on his cell phone while cutting my hair.  He was minimally courteous.

{"label":1,"text":"After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5\/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\\\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\\\"...\\\"Sure, what is it?\\\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak\/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole."}

The first time I used the drive thru was for a deposit (what I normally do) for my business account. I provided the proper slips, everything was filled out correctly, etc. I drive up, no one is at the teller. I send in the deposit in the transport mechanism. No one shows up. Ring the button, no one shows up. Honk the horn, no one shows up. 2 - 3 minutes later some one shows up and says \\\"Oh sorry I didnt see you back here\\\". Then after a couple minute she comes back and has a snide attitude about my deposit and asks me what my title is with the company. I tell her \\\"Founder\/Owner\\\" and she proceeds to send the deposit back to me and asks me to write that on the back of the check next to my existing signature.

I went in because I was having a problem with a  vendor charging my checking account and over drafting it.  Prior to this the only other time I have been charged a any fee was when they switched my account and the bank kept on billing me for a monthly fee in error which they reversed.\\n\\nA girl sat down with me and went over my account.  She was courteous but kept on trying to get me to sign up for things.  I told her I was good but she continued for several minutes until finally she asked what she could do for me.  Funny thing is when I sat down I told her exactly why I was there.  I repeated why I was there and she looked through my account again, the previous ten minutes she looked at my account I guess was just to try to sell me something.  I explained to her about the bank errors fees being waived.  After a long pause she said she had to talk with her manager about reversing the fee and she got up and left.  \\n\\nAnother 7-10 minutes later she comes back and says she couldn't waive the fee.  When I asked why? She said because they had already waived monthly fees.  AGAIN I explained to her that those were waived  because of a bank error.  I asked if I could speak to her manager but she said he was busy and couldn't talk with me.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day the fee didn't bug me as much as the TREATMENT.  They had me there for 20 freakin minutes and this guy couldn't come out of his little back door to talk to me for 2 seconds?  Also,  if you weren't going to waive it why not tell the person in the first few minutes, why drag it out for so long?\\n\\nIn the end I called the 800# and they waived it right away.

They were lush to the point of being a little slow. I didn't see a single dead spot on the greens, so that issue seems to be over. I never would have known they were having such bad issues just 7-8 weeks ago if not for seeing the reviews here.\\n\\nThe restaurant grub was above average and they had several good beers on tap."}

{"label":1,"text":"This place definitely needs to improve on the taste of the food.  We came in expecting a \\\"wow\\\" factor... Food deep fried in lard, highest calories, etc.  I don't know about you, but I thought \\\"high calorie food\\\" was supposed to taste amazing?  I figured since they advertise how high the calories are- that this was going to be the best burger and chili cheese fries I've ever had.  NOT THE CASE!  I came with a big group of people and we all ordered different things, to give the menu a try.  When I got my food, the burger and chili cheese fries were dripping in grease.  The fries had a grease pool formed around them and the chili looked like ground up dog food.  The worst part- the burger and the fries tasted bland!  You would think with that much grease that it would have SOME flavor.  Everyone in our party threw away most of their food.   I will never eat here again.  The only reason why I didn't give this place 1 star is because it does have some \\\"one of a kind\\\" type of experiences.  The staff give you a hospital gown to wear while you eat and the waitresses are all dressed in nurse uniforms and spank you :). I give it to the owner- congrats on contributing to the nationwide obesity epidemic...

When we arrived at NOON every table and chair was reserved with half of the place empty. So a large well built gentleman came out of the kitchen and I walked up to him and said, if every place is reserved can you help us find a place to sit. Without asking us, he turned to this couple and said can 2 people sit with you? I do not mind sitting with people, but it was a set of seats that had our backs to the large TVs and we had to look across the room to very little tvs. We asked for another area and he gave us attitude. VERY VERY BAD service.... apparently they did not want my business and word of mouth has hurt other businesses that I have gone too.

The owner dove into the menu, explaining that he liked to educate his customers so we knew exactly what we were getting. That personal touch won me over immediately.\\n\\nThen the pho came out. I don't exaggerate when I say it was the best I've had in a while. It might have been because of the fresh ingredients the owner told us about, or the good ratio of broth-to-meat-to-veggies, but either way it was delicious. The egg rolls were also tasty, but I just wish we were served more (that's more of a comment on my appetite).\\n\\nI've been back several times, and unPhogettable does not dissapoint.

The taco bell was still the same horrible for me style that I love, and I'd come back for it, but the last couple times of KFC have been downright disappointing. The biscuit was hard and tasted funky, and the chicken itself was very gristly and just not that familiar flavor that kept me coming back. The prices seemed to be a bit higher too... I think I'll venture elsewhere for my late night cravings."}

I wish I just sat at the bar, since the bartender seemed to have more life to him than his server counterparts. Maybe next time I'll go before the game with there might be more life in the staff."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place is quite good and worth traveling outside of uptwon Charlotte to locate (much better than the BBQ I tried in uptown).  They have a good menu selection of pulled pork, chicken and beef brisket, and a healthy choice of sides to choose from.  The problem I had was what to try, but my salvation was the taco plate.  Yeah, that seems like a strange offering in a BBQ place, but you could mix and match 2 or 3 tacos to try all meats (pork, chicken and brisket), and it comes with a choice of side too.  HINT:  The creamed corn, and bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious.  The coleslaw comes on some of the tacos, so you got to try that too, and it was good.  We got fried pickles as an appetizer and a couple of local Carolina craft brews on draft made for an enjoyable meal.  Too full to try the cobbler for dessert, maybe next time."}

I spoke with the owner about it. She was rude and told me that we were given too big of a discount to start, which apparently justifies her trying to screw us at the end. She made up a ridiculous story about how we begged for a discount (her employees OFFERED US the twin discount). \\n\\nThe owner thinks it is fair that we paid for 4 months of service, when we only used it for 3 months (and gave our 30 day notice well in advance before the 2nd month had ended).

{"label":1,"text":"I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. \\n\\nAlthough the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. \\n\\nWhatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate!

Kind of funny but I love having an ABC store nearby; feel like I'm in Hawaii :-) The pool area was nice and safe for the kids. \\nWe stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. It was nice having a full kitchen, though we never used it, and a washer\/dryer was a nice touch, which the wife used. The rooms are nice and quiet. The kids loved the 8 ft. projection screen. Definitely a good compromise for the family with its upscale amenities and being family friendly.\\nThe only negative (and it's small) is the parking. During peak hours, it's hard to find parking since the parking structure is shared with PH and the Miracle Mile. You can pay the $15 valet and not deal with the parking issue. I may just do that the next time.\\nIf you are there to gamble and go crazy, this hotel may not be for you.

{"label":0,"text":"In case some of you didn't already know, I spend alot of time at Coffe shops, namely Starbucks. It's like a second home really. Yesterday morning, in what my wife refers to as, one of my,\\n\\\"My fit's of hopeless optimism.\\\"\\nI figured I'd go and check out some of the Starbucks' running along on McDowell. Boy, wasn't that a mistake. Once inside, I had to look around to see if there was someone with a camera, waiting to gauge my reaction! That's how far off the reservation this Starbucks location had gone... I totally understand that alot of highschool kid's and young adults end up filling  part-time grocery store positions. In fact, I was one of those kids. I worked part time at a Safeway, where I grew up for over a year. But never, And I mean never, would you have caught me dead running the sort of ragtag, dog and pony show, such as the one I was a witness to at the Starbucks inside Safeway at 7th st. And McDowell yesterday. I like to think that I'm a pretty fair reviewer and it take's alot for me to give a \\\"scathing\\\" review. \\nHowever, in this case, it was well deserved. I was hoping to walk in and find a place to sit down, buy a coffee, and work on a project I planned on finishing. \\nWhat I walked into shocked me... And I don't shock easily people. Trust me. \\nFirst thing's first, The \\\"barista\\\" working the kiosk, was standing out front of the kiosk, you know, where customers stand to order. Chatting it up and belligerantly cracking jokes really loud with the bagger\/carryout boy and completely ignoring me. So much so, I sat down ( first having to brush the cracker crumbs and wrappers off my seat) choosing not to even buy a coffee!\\nAssuming  they'd mastered time travel, suddenly we were all rocketed back to middle school! And the bag boy began teasing and chasing the girl \\\"barista\\\" (If you could call her that) around in the small space allotted for Starbucks customers. \\n Listen people, I am the furthest thing from a stick in the mud. And I'll be the first to say kid's should be kid's. But this was ridiculous. Yet more then anything else, it was down right unprofessional. When I pay hard earned cash for a service, I expect that service. Do your job people. Keep the place clean. Then you can mess around all you want. Basically, They crossed the line between high school hijinks, into, \\n\\\"O.k. now your just making your company look bad. The floors were atrocious. Filthy even, With trash under the tables. As if things couldn't get any worse, it smelled. Bad. Like expired ham. That, was definitely a first for me. Never had a Starbucks smelled. Let alone that bad. And last, but certainly not least, they had no outlet's.  I get you want to turn a profit. Well fine, charge for it. Don't just, not provide them. Most people want to be able to charge their electronics while they enjoy their coffee. Come on Starbucks this is a \\\"no-brainer\\\"!\\n O.k. kids, I realize you know everything... \\nAnd what could a 30 year old.  Such as myself possibly  have to teach any of you millennial's that you don't already know?  (Just kidding)\\nBut I did work at Safeway for a year and four months when I was a teenager. All I'm saying is that there's a time and a place for everything.  At work while a customer is staring at you, waiting to be served is not the time, nor the place.\\nNothing and no place will ever be perfect. I don't expect anything to be. I do, however, expect \\\"said place\\\" to, if they have some glaring flaws,  make up for it somewhere along the line...\\nBut with this Starbucks location,  I was sorely disappointed."}

At 4:46am we were forced to wake a sleeping baby, load her in the car seat, and drive to the airport.  Not once did anyone call our phone number.  We are very disappointed in the service.

You can see that the vents have not been cleaned out in quite some time.  \\nThe worst part is that we could not get any sleep until after 2 am due to the music ( or I should say the same beat repeating over and over) from the Voodoo lounge filling our room and shaking our walls.  \\nWe called the front desk to change rooms and were told that no rooms were available.  The manager was supposed to call us which never happened. When we checked out the hotel thought that removing the resort fee was good enough.  After explaining that we had paid for a room that we were supposed to get some sleep in which did not happen the front desk was willing to remove an additional $20.  Wow - hold me back.  Needless to say we are not coming back.\\nFYI  - stay off floor 35 of the masquerade tower."}

It's a very old building And the blankets are like hospital blankets but older. I will never come back here. Honestly, go to a four seasons hotel and it actually cost less with  a steam room and a beautiful built building. I will never ever ever come back here. Horrible experience for my birthday.

Obviously.\\n* The car took us where we wanted to go without any mechanical problems.\\n\\nCons:\\n* The office is small, and, \\\"for customer privacy,\\\" you have to wait outside, in the heat, on a small bench, if another customer is inside. I have never before seen such a concern for privacy outside of a doctor's office, but you'll be in a bad mood by the time you finally enter.\\n* You'll pay a change fee of $10 or $11, even if it's to extend your reservation for another day, as we did. So you're punishing me for giving you MORE business?\\n* The office closes at 5, and the last time you can return the car is at 4:30. And there's no key drop after hours. So that means that you have to get up early and stumble down to the office to return your keys, or pay for an extra day. \\n* The car had smears of what looked like dried, sticky chocolate ice cream in the driver's side door pull and in the cup holders in the center console.\\n\\nIn New York, where I live, car rental companies can treat us like crap and we're used to it. (I don't own a car and rent from my neighborhood Dollar occasionally, but at least their agents are friendly while they gouge us.) Out here, I expect better. Next time, I'll rent at the airport (probably cheaper anyway), and certainly NOT from Dollar. In fact, I'm so pissed off that I may stop using them, regardless of location."}

That is, until I decided to use a Groupon before I moved out of AZ for my possibly last\/final haircut prior to my move (I was enticed by the green\/organic theme).  First off, the actual salon is downstairs and I'm probably the only person who might not have equated \\\"The Green Room\\\" to \\\"being the room that was actually green.\\\"  So I sat down prematurely in the waiting room that was one floor down from Sachi Salon; the actual room is 2 floors down from Sachi.  Tip: It would be ideal for one to venture down to the room where they see a green wall.  \\n\\nJanelle was my hairstylist and not only did she do an awesome job, she pointed out something that I was not aware of and called me later just to check up on me.  Not only was she very sweet and professional, she did a great job on my hair and whatever product that she used left my hair feeling soft for weeks (the haircut also probably helped).  \\n\\nI believe one of the reviews commented on the difficulty in scheduling\/the front desk.  I definitely did not have this problem.  They even called me to let me know that Janelle was running a little behind.

It's also pretty far from the center strip where most of the action is. The club was awesome and I saw the entire team USA there. I also saw Tyrese Gibson. They were all staying at the Wynn. That should tell you something about how fancy this place is. The worst part though, the buffet was horrible. I was like a kid in the candy store when I first saw their brunch. Everything looked so good but looks can be deceiving. I couldn't even finish 1 plate. It gave me a horrible stomach ache and everything was pretty bland. I was so disappointed in the buffet especially."}
{"label":2,"text":"So we hadn't been since this place used to be Cafe Del Sol (yes, a few years ago). We used the Groupon we had purchased about a month ago. It was kind of awkward because there's the main dining room and a separate red-headed step child dining room around the corner, not really attached at all to the main dining room and probably all the excitement. We got there right at the end of happy hour and wifey ordered a glass of Sangria, I had a glass of Tempranillo (that totally blew by the way).  I ended up ordering another glass of wine (don't remember the name) and it was pretty good. I got the cola and pineapple braised short ribs, jalapeno cream corn a chile corn casserole. The sides were good, although the corn casserole was a tad dry. The shorts ribs were great, they didn't have that cheap pot roast taste that some braised short ribs can have. The sauce was a bit thick for my taste, but not a huge deal. Wifey had the grilled shrimp appetizer with avocado and mango sauce appetizer and the empanadas. She loved her food. I wasn't a fan of the empanadas. but the shrimp were pretty good. Overall, I think it's a pretty good place and it's nice to have another option in the area. Would I choose to go back? no, probably not, but I know the wife will make me go back at some point."}

The sushi we ordered was not much better than cheaper places I've been and definitely not my favorite. I don't see where it was worth all the hype. If you're looking to try something new and out of the box, I think this is a good place to do it but if you're a fan of the traditional sushi that you can find anywhere, this is probably not the place. \\n\\nThis will most likely be the last time I go to Nobu...not because I HATED the food, but because I really dislike the clientele. Too many snooty drunk people, talking way too loudly. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends. The waiter had a very heavy accent which made it near impossible to understand what he was saying. Not really his fault, but because of the loud groups of people nearby, it was pretty unbearable. \\n\\nLike my friend said, it was just \\\"ok.\\\" I was expecting more and walked away more annoyed than anything."}

To my surprise, upon me approaching one of the employees to complain about the sandwich, he simply disregarded my comment and continued shuffling bags. I had to call to his attention twice before they acknowledge my presence, after they had heard my comment I was told that they did not give me my sandwich earlier because the \\\"buzzers\\\" were not working properly and I was excused. I, unhappy with the experience wanted to continue to voice my un-satisfaction with the service, such for which I was ignored. However the cashier did proceed to ask the employee if anything was wrong. I approached the cashier and tell her that the sandwich was extremely late and was also cold, comment she acknowledges which such disdain, I FELT EMBARRASSED to have mentioned it in front of the other customers. This was an absolutely terrible and embarrassing experience, I do not come to an establishment to be brushed-off or neglected as just another \\\"assumed\\\" drunk customer, much the less be PATRONIZED and ignored when trying to voice a complaint about the food or services provided.

The good thing about the buffet is we decided to purchase the $35 all day pass which covered food for the day.

The best part of brunch was the all you can drink champagne :)\\n\\nDinner was a basic meal that included rice, some type of fish and some veggies,.. they also had a pasta bar which was pretty awesome, also a section for chinese food and a section for dessert.

{"label":2,"text":"I am bit conflicted on how to rate this place. There were a few things I liked about it and a few I did not. Three stars seem a bit low, while four seems too much. Perhaps 3.5?\\n\\nFirst, the decor and ambiance is great!\\nI really enjoyed the fusion of food: Brazilian, Peruvian, & Japanese. The rolls were just ok, but the ceviche and tiraditos were really good. As expected, it was pricey and small. However, unless you are in Peru, you are not going to get large ceviche plates for cheap. I also liked the Caipirinha. The service wasn't bad but was also not very attentive. One thing that bothered me is that the gentleman that brought our pitcher of Caipirinha (hey! it wasn't just for me, people) and when he was serving my cup, the top came out and a bunch of the caipirinha spilled over on the table and a bit on me. Well, the staff handled it well. They apologized and cleaned the mess. However, the inner alky in me was having a fit because I felt the spilled at least a glass worth of the drink and didn't bring us more or maybe a give us a bit discount on the pitcher (just the pitcher). I think that would have been a nice gesture, since it was like if they brought me one drink, they drop it, and not bring me a new one. I really don't think it was absolutely necessary, but it would have been nice costumer service.\\n\\nOverall, I would come back!"}

But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\\n \\nWhen I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).

{"label":1,"text":"Tough review to write, because it's hard to separate how happy I am in my marriage from how happy I was with the wedding. But, this review needs to be written.\\n\\nNichole was our wedding planner. It was a small wedding, just 20 guests total. That isn't an unusual size for the Forever Grand chapel. There are two chapel rooms, one for weddings about our size and one for weddings about twice that size. It would be easy to say that we didn't get the stellar customer service because of the size of our wedding (oh, they must have been focused on bigger events) which is why I bring up the size. If anything, this is in the sweet spot for Forever Grand. Events the size of ours should be where they excel.\\n\\nMost of the folks who get married here do not live in Las Vegas. It's a destination wedding, and we were no different. We were really taken by the Hollywood Glamour package, which was around $1200 and included vintage hair and makeup, some flowers, some photos, videography, the chapel, the officiant, and the services of a wedding planner. The price seemed very reasonable. And no running around trying to schedule and arrange all those different services? Was exactly the \\\"no muss, no fuss\\\" we were looking for.\\n\\nWe booked four months in advance. From the very first contact with Forever Grand, I was nervous.\\n\\nThe first email reply from our wedding planner, with the contract for us to sign and deposit to make to hold the chapel? It was wrong. In fact, it listed that day's date as the date of our wedding, and listed that as the date to pay the remaining balance as well. Not a good start. First contact and the attention to detail is not there. Any bride (or groom who has a bride) can tell you, weddings are ALL about details. You go on a website like theknot.com and you find out you have a couple hundred decisions to make before your wedding. You need all of those to run smoothly.\\n\\nBut hey, maybe it's just a one time thing? So we get the corrected version of the contract. It looks ok. Send it back. Yay, we have a wedding started!\\n\\nNext couple emails are pretty slow replies. But hey, she is mostly working on weddings that are only a few weeks out, so no worries right?\\n\\nWe get the questionnaire via email that lets us make about 100 different decisions. So we spend a couple weeks getting those nailed down and send it back. Our wedding is really simple. Just a matron of honor and a best man. No other bridesmaids, no groomsmen, no flower girl, no ring bearer. No rehearsal. Should be as easy as pie.\\n\\nThe only real customization we had was that we wanted red and cream sand for our sand ceremony, we wanted a completely civil ceremony (not religious at all), some upgraded flowers at the front, and special music to play when we exited (which we provided on CD). Four things total that we were deciding. Everything else was pretty much, do whatever you normally do.\\n\\nSo we get our confirmation email, and it has someone else's name and email address on it. WTF? Seriously? Another call back to Nichole. Oops, sorry, we will send you the right one.\\n\\nOk, here we go. Check it over, looks good, looks, good. Hey wait a minute. Our contract said there was a $100 weekend premium. This says $200. Another call to Nichole. Oops, sorry. Send you the right one.\\n\\nAlright, I am now pretty nervous about whether anything is actually going to turn out ok. And mind you, I am the groom! I shouldn't be nervous about anything other than oversleeping the morning of the ceremony.\\n\\nSo we show up a couple days in advance to Vegas. We stop by the chapel. Everything is good. It's all going to be fine. Sigh of relief. We will be ok.\\n\\nOr not.\\n\\nDay of the ceremony. Everybody getting ready. Stand here. Walk there. When this happens, you do this. Ok, we are good to go. Stand. Wait. Stand. Wait. aaaaaaaand. Here Comes The Bride! Yay! We are getting married! Father of the bride makes his handoff. Female guests are crying. We turn to face the officiant.\\n\\nHe starts in on bible verses.\\n\\nWHAT. THE. FUCK.\\n\\nWhat part of \\\"we want a civil ceremony\\\" was not understood?\\n\\nNow mind you, I have been to church plenty of times. And the bible verses used in weddings aren't exactly the worst sentiments ever. Heck, we all like to hear that we are going to be happy forever with the support of our families. And I am sure some of the people in the audience were happy to hear those verses. But we didn't ask for them.\\n\\nGo through the steps of the wedding. It is far too late to try to change anything anyway. Just take them as kind words. It's a beautiful day. Smile and enjoy.\\n\\nTime for the sand ceremony. And, the sand isn't red. It's tan. So instead of the red and cream, we have tan and white. Sigh.\\n\\nAs we leave, our music plays. And we are caught up in the joy of being married. It is a wonderful day with friends and family.\\n\\nIf you don't care about details, Forever Grand is 4 stars.\\nIf you do, or your bride does? Expect maybe half of your requests to be honored and accurate. Two stars."}

{"label":2,"text":"I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14\\\" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.

I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right."}

We waited another 15 minutes before the server (bartender) decided to come out from behind the bar and actually take our orders.  He was too busy having a good time, apparently telling jokes with his bus boy buddies.\\n\\nThe pizza I ordered was awful....much worse than somethiing that wouldl show up at my front door from a Pizza Hut order.  The rest of the food was good so Claim Jumpers gets two stars instead of 1 but it's safe to say I will never be going back to Claim Jumpers again."}

{"label":4,"text":"FIrst let me mention that I am a Chicago native and this means I know pizza.  This place serves the closest to Chicago style deep dish pizza I have found since leaving home.  (closer to Uno's and Connies than Giorgano's but we will take it). This could be because their other locations are all in Illinois. They also serve thin (sliced correctly, in squares), double crust, pan, and stuffed.  Upon being seated, the table receives (free) a basket of the most delightful garlic parmesan bread bites we have ever tasted.  These, plus a salad, would be enough for a normal person's dinner.  But no, get the pizza and take it home.  A medium deep dish will feed your house for the next few days, and warms up as delicious as first served.  Sadly, filling up on the bread and anticipating a pizza meal was not enough for us.  We also ordered the cheesy bacon fries.  We were overstuffed but not sorry.  These feature real bacon, two cheeses and dipping sauce.  We have never, ever, had fries this good.\\nThe restaurant is cute and comfortable with Italian country decor, but a bit small.  A large party with children came in when we were in mid meal and we were asked to move to a booth so they could push all the tables on one side of the room together. We did not mind moving, unfortunately the large party with children in the small space subjected us to learning much more about the lives and activities of them and their children than we ever wanted or needed to know. Size feels like a real restaurant in Italy without the outdoor seating.They provide linen napkins but no tablecloths.  The staff provided regular check-ins to see if we needed anything, refilled beverages without being asked and the food was served promptly. The server was extremely patient with an elderly foursome who did not understand their check or how to use an entertainment coupon (close quarters, we heard it all clearly).\\nIn summary, I would gladly chance the possibility of loud families in close quarters to feast on those delightful bread bites and the great pizza."}

{"label":2,"text":"When I first discovered this place, I (or some member of my family) came religiously so I could satisfy my craving for the chicken kabob plate. This meal, to me, was the perfect blend of my favorite stuff: grilled boneless chicken kabob, perfectly seasoned rice and awesome salad. We even braved the terrible service of the girl who used to answer the phone (she was very rude) to come and get this food!\\n\\nHowever, at some point they decided to change things around. The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella. I love cheese but I loved feta in this setting more so the change was annoying to me. By far, though, the rice change realllllly got me. It got me so much that I stopped eating here.\\n\\nThen, I decided to give it another try. To my surprise, the rice was ALMOST back to what it used to be. I was temporarily happy again!! Until, several weeks later, another craving hit and I went back to get takeout and I was given the type of rice that I hate. This ruined the entire meal for me. I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.\\n\\nIn any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him. He recognizes some members of my family and says hi and that is nice also. I do hope the restaurant does well and maybe one day I'll be back (maybe)."}

{"label":0,"text":"I have played both courses in years past and I must say, both have gone downhill.  Champions is filled with unprepared divots and unbelievable amount of ballparks on the greens.  It's like maintenance isn't doing anything all the sudden.  Maybe the PGA is in a poor financial position because they definately are not keeping it up.\\n\\n    Stadium is the worst I've ever played it.  Most unprepared ball marks I've ever seen, course is ridiculously soft and the greens are not only hairy (rolling about 6) they also didn't even mow the first foot of the green all the way around.  All in all, for what they charge, they should be ashamed at the conditions.  They claim a PGA Tour Experience, but no PGA Tour player would put up with these embarrassing conditions.\\n\\n      Last, I'll say that our caddies, while nice guys, were a BIG part of the problem.  I've played Bandon Dunes, Chambers Bay, Torrey Pines, Pebble and many other caddie clubs.  TPC Caddies are the worst trained I've ever seen.  They are a big part of the maintenance issue.  Finally, after watching both caddies not fix a ball mark or fill a divot in 5 holes...I told them I expected each of them to fix 3 ball marks per hole at minimum and to fill as many divots as they could.  Embarrassing for the course for me to have to tell them that.  Whoever is training the caddies should be fired!!\\n\\n       I also played Grayhawk and Weekopah.  One thousand percent difference.  Both greens were good, courses well maintained and service was great.  \\n\\n        Of all the golf I've played, I'd say if you pay less than $90 to play Stadium Course,  it's worth it.  Any more than that, go to Weekopah or Grayhawk.  For the Champions Course, don't pay more than $49.  You'll be disappointed."}

Really, they do. Nothing I hate more than being greeted by a surly or condescending host\/hostess that shoots you that smug \\\"You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?\\\"** look, while giving you grief over your reservation  - actually, we were 10 minutes late, but they weren't too crowded, so they sat us immediately.\\n\\nLast night was our second visit to Dressler's. We'd been looking forward to coming back after our first visit, which was wonderful in its own right. To our delight, we were offered a table outside. Let me paint the picture for you: you're facing the greenway off Metropolitan Avenue, you have an unfettered view of uptown Charlotte from where you've been seated - and watching the light show on the Duke Tower is truly wonderful - and you couldn't ask for a nicer August evening, free from oppressive humidity. In other words, the perfect spot for a fantastic meal and some people watching.\\n\\nWe were greeted by our waiter, who identified himself as Johnny Utah***. Seriously. Helpful, attentive, exactly what you want in a waiter.\\n\\nThe wedge salad is a staple in any fine dining establishment, and their Wedgie is no exception. Yeah, it's a wedge salad, but it's a phenomenal wedge salad. I also sampled their grilled sausage, accompanied by some very tasty arugula. Outstanding.\\n\\nFor our main course, my wife opted for the ribeye with a side of steamed spinach. The mark of a quality eating establishment can be narrowed down to a simple question: can you grill a good steak? Of course Dressler's can! When you can cut a steak with a fork, you know they're giving you top-quality meats, grilled by someone who knows how to grill a ribeye. She loves their ribeye; it just might be her favorite in town.\\n\\nI went for the seared Mahi, accompanied by gnocchi and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce. Perfect, in its preparation, its size, and its presentation. Best yet, I hadn't even been in the mood for Mahi, but if it looks good on the menu, then I know it's going to taste even better.\\n\\nFinally, yes, what you've heard about Dressler's cheesecakes is absolutely true. Best cheesecake in Charlotte, no question about it. Game over, pal. Dressler's cheesecake is the undisputed heavyweight champion. So good was their featured cheesecake - Oreo Cheesecake! - that my wife called it \\\"pure, concentrated evil that'll make you lose your load.\\\" No kidding. I would have ordered a slice of my own, and given myself into such delicious evil.\\n\\nYou really can't ask for a better dining experience, without the pomp and pretense. Dressler's is fine dining without the snooty (SNOOTY?) or snobby (SNOBBY?) atmospherics.****\\n\\nWhen a restaurant is better the second time around, you know you've found a keeper. Dressler's is now on my list of Must-Eat Places. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n* Actually, it was my Mercedes C350. I prefer modesty over extravagance.\\n\\n** Ugh.

First of all I expected the peppers to be green but they were red. I also expected the ingredients finely chopped, they weren't.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was good but a little too greasy for me. With nothing but a fancy napkin to blot it with, I just didn't blot. The slices are big so that's a plus.\\n\\nAlso tried their basic vinaigrette salad which was okay, again not the best and the dressing wasn't mixed that well against the greens (come on people).\\n\\nMy favorite thing here was their iced tea that had a hint of passion tea but wasn't sweet. \\n\\nDue to the wind outside we were forced to sit inside and were not able to enjoy the sounds of the waterfalls outside."}

Also, the sound was pretty bad and the picture wasn't great. We were watching \\\"Devil\\\", and it wasn't all that scary because the theater wasn't even dark enough during the black out moments to really get the effect.  Major points for extending matinee prices till 6 PM - otherwise you might as well just see a movie at the $1 cinema. The quality is the same, you just wait a couple months and get to save $5."}

Not the cleanest\\nOrdered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot\\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$\\n\\nExpensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.\\n\\nTo top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)"}

{"label":0,"text":"I got a slightly bad feeling when I walked in to pick up our carry out order. It smelled like sewage!  There were three servers chit chatting in the front and one quickly pointed to the bar when I told the I was picking up. The small bar was fairly full, and lots of conversations going on. I had to stand behind two people who were really involved in conversation and I was practically on top of them and awkward. The bar tender didn't acknowledge me for a few minutes even though she looked right at me. Finally she grabbed my order and was super rude. She was definitely having a bad day.  The place was empty other than the bar, and I don't know why they don't use the servers who aren't busy to take care of the carry out orders!?\\n\\nFinally got home with the food.  Wow.  My husband opened his Jumbo Smoked Chicken dinner.  It was quite small, and just unappealing altogether.  Posted a photo of it, check it out.  The taste was like \\\"rubbery ham\\\".  GROSS.  Next I opened my smoked chicken breast sandwich.  Bun = hard, meat = full of fat chunks and gristle, sauce = the cheapest bottle at the store . Had to take off more than half of the \\\"meat\\\".  You can get better meat in precooked packages at the grocery store.  \\n\\nI will never eat here again and can not believe people go here at all.  NASTY."}
{"label":3,"text":"Very Beautiful... We stayed for eight days total which is a long time, and i can say we had any complaints. we arrived around 10am and the check in was at 3pm, but after trying to get us to upgrade to a higher floor, because supposedly they didn't have anything else available,(we were prepare to wait ) but they did find us a room with absolutely no view, except the back of another building, but after such long flight, I didn't care. This hotel really does have everything you need we hardly went anywhere else, except to see other shows. The Pallazzo hotel which is basically the same because they are connected, was beautiful, out of 5 restaurants we tried inside the hotel 4 were amazing. The suites are very spacious, the cheapest suite you can get there is really, really nice, loved the decor. The reason I don't give it the five stars is because i thought the beds weren't that comfortable and the pillows are terrible, and I really didn't feel like the Hotel staff doesn't go out of their way to make your experience special, like other big hotel I have stayed at. Places that are a must try at the Venetian hotel and Resort: \\n* Morels steak house and French Bistro: very pricey but sooo worth it, they have a special menu for wine and cheese parings is $35 for three different glasses of wine and three little pieces of cheese, the also include honey, preserves and slices of bread...Amazing!!! \\n*The Blue man group: great show, very, very funny, great for kids. but beware the front row seats of the theater are the cheapest, and even though they give you a poncho to protect your clothes , you can get wet and or dirty. \\n\\nTwo things i was looking forward to doing during my stay at the venetian and regret doing: \\n\\n* Lavo nightclub: not worth the high cover charge and they huge line to get in, you won't be missing out on anything special. \\n\\n*gondolas rides: you pay $16 per person or $64 if you want the gondola to be private, is a 5 min ride, you have to wait about an hour to go on it, kinda of boring... \\n\\n\\nGood hotel but it really didn't impress me, next time I'll try something else, maybe I had too many high expectations,but for for the price of this rooms who wouldn't.?"}

The building is historic and has been home to many former businesses - the building dates to the 1800s. \\n\\nFree House's beer, cocktail, and separate whiskey menu are extensive.  This explains the crowded bar area in the entryway around happy hour on my visit.  The food attempts to match other local upscale bar food (The Great Dane, The Laurel Tavern, Coopers Tavern).  Granted, the crowds I've seen here are mainly divided into the bar group and families with children in the dining area and neither are likely going to demand fussy hipster ingredients.  Chicken fingers, a standard burger, and grilled cheese are all available.  The restaurant does have sweet potato fries, parmesean fries, and a homemade vegetarian chili, though, so it's not exactly a country dive bar, either.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian, I appreciated the availability of a veggie burger made in-house.  I had mine with a side of greens.  It was fairly good, though needed some sort of additional moisture from sauce or veggies.  My friend's \\\"Big Tex\\\" burger was loaded with sauce and needed to be cut in half to avoid a BBQ fashion emergency.  The goat cheese beet salad and fish fry special (on a Wednesday night, no less) at the neighboring table looked like good bets for next time.\\n\\nService is quick and prices are reasonable.

{"label":1,"text":"I had one appointment with Dr. Harter while I was baby doctor shopping after moving here from Boston. Moving from Boston, where ALL my my doctors, in every single discipline, had an ivy league education and were board certified to Las Vegas, where, well, that is sooo far from the case, proved to be a little challenging to find quality care. \\nDr. Harter seems to have found his niche as Vegas' \\\"natural doctor\\\" because he's the only one in the valley that does VBACs and water births. It's nice that he is supportive of this, but I got the impression that he is just in this field because it's probably pretty lucrative being the only one. I'm really passionate about natural birth and I asked him a ton of questions, like will baby and mom be left undisturbed for an hour after birth; what is the backup plan should Dr. Harter be attending another birth; how supportive is the hospital of breastfeeding; and the answers were just not really satisfactory by my standards. \\nDr. Harter's procedures were also not only not consistent with natural-minded patients, but not really good practice for ANY OB. At the first appointment, he gave me a sheet of \\\"okay medications.\\\" When you're pregnant, there's no such thing as universally \\\"okay medications!\\\" And, there were medications on the sheet that have recently been linked to a three times increase in miscarriage (according to an article on CNN). So not okay! Not to mention, handing a sheet that says \\\"if you have a headache, take this\\\"; \\\"if you have a stomach ache, take this\\\"; means that he does not take the time to personally consult over what could be serious symptoms. My OB in Boston (who has her medical degree from Yale) advised me not to take ANY medications without checking with her first. \\nDr. Harter also wheeled in an ultrasound machine, even though there was no indication whatsoever to do an ultrasound. The AAP, and the ACOG recommend against non-medically indicated ultrasounds, as there have been some studies pointing to possible harm of too many ultrasounds. Just the doppler is fine! But, a doctor can bill more to insurance for doing an ultrasound! \\nAside from my experience with the doctor himself, the office staff was terrible! It took me over a month to get an appointment! They refused to book an appointment until I sent over my records from Boston, which I sent promptly, and they then LOST. Yes, they lost my medical records. So, I sent them again, and they never called me; I called them 2.5 weeks later. \\nThe office really felt like a cattle call as well. There were sooo many people in the waiting room, and we waited for 2.5 hours!! Dr. Harter was attending a birth and didn't reschedule me or any of his other patients during this time (but hey, why lose the billable visits?). And, as much as I was not at all happy about the crazy unreasonable wait, I would really hate to be that poor woman giving birth with a doctor attending that knew in the back of his head that he had to get back as quickly as possible to see a rapidly growing list of waiting patients that he didn't reschedule. \\nBut as awful as this sounds given all of the negatives above, if I HAD to have a doctor in Las Vegas, I would likely go with him, given the extremely slim pickings here and his at least openness to a natural approach (and he's board certified - again hard to find around here). But luckily, I found a fantastic midwife that I'm really really comfortable with."}

Its actually kind of tough to find... tucked away in a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants.\\n\\nWe sat down and were greeted by a very nice waiter. We both ordered an Indian beer and asked for suggestions. He pointed a few out and we got to ordering.\\n\\nAppetizer was a Lamb Kabob (but they take out the stick before it is served). Just ground lamb with some saut\\u00e9ed onions and peppers. It was accompanied by a few sauces. It was ok but certainly nothing earth shattering.\\n\\nThen we ordered two entrees he recommended. One was a shrimp dish with a reddish curry. The other was chicken vindaloo. Pretty much chicken with potatoes in a yellowish curry.\\n\\nHe also suggested we get some nan (a flat bread) and some rice, advising the dishes were family style.\\n\\nHope I don't sound to crabby, but the portions were crap. I was expecting it to be like a Chinese restaurant where you get a good portion to share. NOPE. The shrimp dish had a whopping 6 shrimp. For $14 bucks I expected much more than that, especially after teh family style\/sharing comment. If I go to a Chinese place and get spicy shrimp they bring out a proper portion. \\n\\nSame with the chicken. Maybe 6 or 8 chunks of chicken with a little potatoes. Same story as above. Anywhere else and I'd get a mountain of chicken. Enough to share, right?!\\n\\nThe little bit of lamb was $13, plus they also charged for the nan and rice. $3 bucks each.\\nAnyway, the food was definitely good, but when accompanied by a $67 bill (plus $13 tip), this was probably the smallest $80 meal I've had. Both my client and I could have eaten much more if allowed.\\n\\nSo I guess to sum it up. Good food but not at its price point. Those things have to line up to get a glowing review from this Yelper.\\n\\nHighly recommend it though if price isn't a big concern.

The food... always as I remembered.. Chicken is always crispy and the gravy adds just a perfect touch to the crunchy wonder and to complete your Jollibee experience would be their famous spaghetti! \\n\\nNow.... for the service. Since it was the sunday before Labor Day... Jollibee was rockin at lunchtime and so was the chaos. But for several of my family members we shared a family meal of a bucket of chicken with spaghetti and rice.  I believe the order came with 3 pies. We ordered 2 peach\/mango pies and a banana\/langka pie along with a bottle of water. \\n\\nWe got our order, but no pies.. We ate and after the meal I brought the receipt back to the counter and told the employee from which we ordered our meal...she referred us to the manager (she was wearing a blue top with glasses, bun on her head).  I explained we received our order except for the pies.  Instead of simply apologizing and giving the  pies... she goes on to tell me she filled the order herself and remembers the bottle of water and that she put the pies on the tray. I told her, \\\"no... sorry... we did not receive any pies.\\\" She then states, \\\"well... where were you sitting.\\\" I told her where we were sitting. (Not that I needed to do that... she basically IMPLIED THAT I WAS LYING!) Seriously!!!!#$%^&*() Then she tells me.... \\\"I put the order together... I remember I put the water on the tray. After going back and forth for a few minutes... I told her do you think it is possible (in this crazy world we live in) that someone else ordered chicken and spaghetti at Jolibee's along with a BOTTLE OF WATER! \\n\\nC'mon! \\n\\nIt's not until I asked her... \\\"are you seriously going to argue with me about pies?\\\" then she looked embarrassed... and just gave me the pies cause she didn't want her employees and other patrons staring.  Didn't look at me... didn't say sorry. Just tossed the pies. I almost said prior to her giving the pies... forget it... just give me my money back.

{"label":0,"text":"Caff\\u00e8 Art Java on Mont-Royal was, when it first opened, my favorite cafe in the whole world.  Great location; sleek, but inviting, ambiance; decent food; and mind-blowing latt\\u00e9s.  What wasn't to like?  I was a steady-going regular for years.\\n\\nI was concerned when I learned the founders had sold the place, but I hoped the new owners would leave everything more or less untouched.  And at first they mostly did.  But things still started to slide.  The new owners started advertising their menu using grainy photos--appropriate for late-night Chinese take-out, but not an upscale cafe. The kitchen and barista staff turned over almost immediately--to be replaced, we think, by the owners. And so the food became barely adequate and the coffee, frankly, went to hell.\\n\\nI eventually stopped being a regular, but I still went every now and then because the ambiance was still great. No more. One of the owners forced me to pay for a tisane that I never received.  Some time ago, I ordered a tisane that never arrived at my table. I got so engrossed in my work that I didn't really notice; in fact, I only noticed that it hadn't arrived when it was time for me to pack it up and go. So I left, slightly miffed that I never got my tisane. Annoying, but mostly harmless and certainly innocent. It's the kind of brain fart that can happen to any server.\\n\\nA week or so later, I went to the cash to pay my bill and the owner who was working the register presented me with TWO bills: one for that day's tisane, and one for the tisane I never received. I protested, saying that I had never received the earlier beverage. The owner insisted that she distinctly and specifically remembered preparing this tisane, which I never received. This went back and forth several times until I thought it had been made clear that if she made me pay for something I never received, I would never come back. The owner insisted, so I paid both tickets.\\n\\nThe owner's decision to push the issue over my strong protests (no matter what she does or doesn't remember) says everything that needs saying about the new management at Art Java. Maybe she thought she was being tough or something, but did she really think I was trying to wriggle out from paying $3? I was a _regular_. Does she not realize that she's basically calling me a liar and a thief? In any case, $3 is apparently more than my good opinion (which, at bottom, equates to all of the business they might ever get from me) is worth to them.\\n\\nAt Art Java, every penny counts--but every customer, not so much."}

{"label":2,"text":"Tasty lunch- and conveniently located by my work! Have heard good things about this place, and likely will return to try their dinner offerings at a later date.\\n\\nPicked up two sandwiches on my way home and half-and-half'd it for dinner today and lunch tomorrow. I ordered the Parma (a spread of european olives and pepperocini topped with assorted italian meats & cheeses including imported provolone & mortadella from parma, italy, topped with shredded lettuce, olive oil & balsamic vinegar) and the Campania (Fresh\\u200b mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, sliced tomatoes, balsamic dressing), both Regular sized, for a total just under $15.\\n\\nThe Parma is more of my BF's kind of sammie: heavy on the meats, bold on flavor. I'm glad I ordered it warmed in the oven, the cheese was just the slightest bit melted and I felt that the contrast between meats became a little bit more distinct. Did not add the balsamic to this one until the last few bites, which changed the flavor slightly but wasn't necessary IMO.\\nThe Campania is definitely my kind of sandwich: pesto and tomato and mozz balls, that's like the trifecta of Italian perfection, and I'm so glad I ordered it. I favored this sandwich as it was light and flavorful, and the pesto especially was just spot on. Also did not add the balsamic to this sandwich, but there was already some on the bread under the ingredients. Would order again, and would probably splurge on the large. Loved how plentiful the mozzarella balls were on my portion, not stingy at all!\\n\\nOnly criticism was that the type of bread used for the sandwiches (different for each) and the overabundance of ingredients made for large sandwiches that were difficult to eat- as in, I could not open my mouth wide enough. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because I really feel that the quantity and quality of ingredients justify the pricing and make a good value, but it also made me glad that I was eating my order at home instead of in a dining room- it was a little awkward.\\n\\nI'll be back for dinner, Chef Marc- gonna do a whole separate review on the uni linguini. Anyone wanna give me a shout when it's a featured special again?"}
{"label":2,"text":"Usually I would have something better to say about this place but my last experience was not the best. I have to say I have been in a few Wild Wing locations but this location is BY FAR the tackiest of them all. It looks like a novelty store threw up or something. There are multi colour, beach themed murals on the walls, a Giant light up palm tree, saloon style old western doors and all kinds of junk hanging from the ceiling including sports jerseys, athletic bags and other various sports related items. It really is over the top cluttered and hectic and this is coming from a person who thinks the decor at Jack Astors is great. So that's gotta tell you something. Anways, on my last visit I order medium wings, which is rare for me because I tend to prefer somthing hotter but I was sharing with a friend who doesn't like spicy food. When our wings arrived we both bit into them we just looked at eachother with panic beucase our mouths were burning. I chugged half a beer because they were that hot, which for me would be fine but my friend looked like she was going to fall off her chair. When the waitress came back we explained how hot they were and my friend told her she would not be able to eat them the waitress said \\\"Well yeah, the medium wings here are pretty hot\\\" and looked at us with confusion as if we were supposed to just know this or something. We asked if there was anything she could do and she offered to bring us out some ranch dip or mild sauce which to me is a joke. I used to work in a Sports Bar and I know for a fact I would have immediately offered new wings or at least a credit to the bill. Instead she offered nothing, so my friend ate nothing and we paid and left. I will go back because I have had better experiences there in the past but all in all the customer service was not good. I must say however, I did like the wings and I usually order hot and quite honestly I think the medium ones are hotter so I will likely order the medium in the future."}

We head all the way back down to let them know of the situation and they give us the exact same room three floors up, but we don't get any upgrade for our troubles. Lame. My only other beef with this hotel was the stupid night stand light that would not turn off. It was extremely difficult to fall asleep with a light that stayed on right above your bed. Other than that, my stay was pretty pleasant.\\n\\nThe suites are amazing! They are huge in size and can comfortably fit seven people without a hitch. Keeping the guests in mind, the Palazzo provides a pullout bed, which is actually comfortable for the suites. The beds are very comfortable, and these kinds of suites were made for large groups. As always, the bathrooms are also large and nicely decorated. There is even a small television in the bathroom, which was new to me! I thought the remote control to operate the curtains and blinds were a nice touch. I thought those kinds of things were reserved for hotels like the Wynn, but Palazzo delivered. \\n\\nThe best part of staying here? Easy and quick access to the tables downstairs - specifically craps. Thanks for the good times and paying me and my friends off on that heater table.

Then a day later an automated \\\"urgent\\\" phone call saying I never returned the car. Seriously?!? It takes 4 days for them to realize an $85,000.00 luxury car wasn't returned??? Considering it was already returned, I don't know what's worse. The fact that is was and they had no clue or the fact that it took a machine 4 days to call me asking about it. After multiple attempts to reach the people at the actual Hertz desk at the airport without going through the 800 number and talking to someone in Michigan. I finally had to take time out of my day to drive back down to the airport only to wait in line and then speak to a manager. Never in my life have I met a more lazy, incompetent, unapologetic manger (Veronica). When I walked up she was sitting down in her chair at the desk(no other employee was sitting even though they all had chairs at their computers) I explain the situation and she proceeds to make 4 different phone calls trying to locate the \\\"unreturned\\\" car. After she finds it she informs me it was put to the side so parts could be ordered for it. She asks the person on the other line if she needs to charge me for the parts?

If you have questions, they offer a Thursday session for you to get your questions answered since you really cannot get into details of your treatment at the time of service (do to the community setting).

{"label":4,"text":"Another sushi restaurant in town (I think Kamakura?) claims to be the only \\\"Japanese-owned\\\" Japanese restaurant in Champaign.  I've eaten at Sushi Kame on several occasions, and I have overheard the hostess speak to the other staff in Japanese several times.  Although the owner's ethnicity might not be the sole indication of authenticity and quality, I certainly think Sushi Kame's menu provides sufficient evidence of the restaurant's potential.\\n\\nOn a winter night several months ago, I decided to stop into Sushi Kame for dinner.  Cold fish doesn't alleviate the chill in one's bones, but I thought that a hearty bowl of udon (noodle soup) might do the job.  As I took the menu from my waitress, I glanced at the list of daily specials and saw that sukiyaki was being served.  This wasn't the type of trendy, flashy food that readily pervades American culinary consciousness, but home-style Japanese comfort food.  When the waitress brought it out, I was surprised to see the slices of rare beef and shirataki noodles served in the traditional iron skillet used  to prepare this dish.  Like much of Japanese cuisine, the flavors of my dinner were simple and clean, but the meal was nevertheless hearty and perfect for winter.\\n\\nBecause other reviewers have already commented on the quality of sushi here, I will instead focus my review on some of the other dishes served at Sushi Kame.  My favorite appetizer to order at Sushi Kame is the agedashi tofu, several pieces of lightly-breaded soft tofu in a classic Japanese dressing (soy sauce, dashi, mirin, etc.).  If I have time to relax in the afternoon, I like to stop by and order one of their lunch bento boxes, which are fantastic deals as you are given: an entree of your choice (usually some kind of teriyaki), white rice, a salad (pretty modest, made mostly with iceberg lettuce), several pieces of tempura (I'm delighted when I get a piece of Japanese pumpkin with mine), and a few pieces of sushi.  Meals also come with a small somen and cucumber salad (don't expect much; you can finish it in 2 bites) and miso soup (pretty standard).  I absolutely adore the teriyaki at Sushi Kame, a mix of grilled meat (or tofu) and vegetables, including carrots, onions, green beans, and HUGE, DELICIOUS pieces of teriyaki-flavored GARLIC!  I've also eaten the tonkatsu (Japanese fried pork chop), which is fairly simple and good enough for people who crave it.\\n\\nEveryone fosters a love for their own favorite Japanese town, and while Sushi Kame might not have the flair of KoFusion (with its dance club-inspired decor) or Kamakura (with its teppanyaki performances), I would recommend it as an elegant establishment that offers its own menu of worthy Japanese food."}

The sangria was great...we ended up eating all the fruit inside the pitcher, which were wine soaked.  Besides the chicken paella and iberiberico tapas, we also got a couple other tapas, risotto with mushrooms and something else i cannot remember.  Dinner wasn't cheap, it came to $180 for 2 people, but we can't wait to go back the next time we're in Vegas."}

Cheap varnished pine slats and chairs colors that don't match the table color make this a quirky place that appears thrown together.  \\n\\nThe food *was* good, but too expensive for the (lack of) atmosphere - a waffle, 1 egg, 3 strips of bacon is $9.  \\n\\nCramped seating makes this a poor option for kids."}

I really liked the combo bath\/shower and double sinks - super convenient.\\n\\nThe concierge asked if we were celebrating anything (which we were) and she extended our check-out time to noon (yay) and I received some goodies in our room for my birthday. I recommend leaving your bags in the car if you are checking in before their check-in time. Our room wasn't ready early so they text us when it was. They gave us the keys ahead of time so when we received the text we could just walk into our room and not have to wait in the line for check-in again.\\n\\nOnly downside to this stay was the usb port technology. We couldn't connect our phones to play our music throughout the room which totally sucked. We didn't have enough time to call for service as we were getting ready to head out to a concert. Wish it would have worked - we spent probably 30 minutes trying to figure it out ourselves.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not impressed- I grew up with Albertsons stores in Texas, but they closed up and moved out around the time I hit middle school. When I moved to LV I was excited to be able to shop here again.\\n\\nThis location is severely lacking. It's old and dirty, not particularly well stocked or well staffed, and the prices on non-sale items can be a bit ridiculous compared to other places in the city.\\n\\nWent by when I was on this side of town for a work training, around 8PM. Only one cashier available, Toni, who was openly griping about the job and the customers- TO HER CUSTOMERS. A bit ridiculous.\\n\\nI grabbed a sale ad when I walked in the door but quite a few items on sale weren't even in stock or were low- only one case of Albersons' brand water, only one case of their house brand 18-count eggs, etc. \\n\\nThe produce section is confusing, not well laid out, and inconvenient- I only spotted three plastic bag stations, and they were very spaced out, requiring me to go back and forth repeatedly across the entire area. Luckily I was the only person there.\\nBut then when I wanted to double check the weight of my veggies, I notice there is only one functional scale to be found. Heaven forbid this place ever have more than five shoppers at once, it would be incredibly irritating.\\n\\nSubtracting an additional star for the hella-gross rotisserie chicken and sides area, which was already broken down- the large pans with self-serve sides in them were scraped out and filled with water that looked and smelled old. No idea how early they must have broken that station down, but again- it was only 8PM when I went in. Went against my better judgement and got a rotisserie chicken for dinner, and it was small, dry, and had seen better days."}

{"label":1,"text":"At first glance, walking inside of The Yard is enchanting. The outdoor game area is unique and we had a lot of fun playing games together this afternoon. \\n\\nHowever, I was not at all impressed with how management handles their restaurant. Our server was amazing, but everybody else we dealt with today was rude\/aloof (possibly racist?:-( ). If I'm paying premium prices for fish and chips, I expect friendly service from ALL staff and management. Instead of accommodating a large birthday party (of which they were aware would be present well in advance), we were placed in awkward seating arrangements and scolded by management for moving tables to allow more people to sit together. No suggestions or accommodations were offered, we had to advocate for different seating that would be more suitable for our needs in an *empty* restaurant. If the restaurant had been even remotely busy, I could understand why this might be an issue, but the place was practically deserted. What makes me use the \\\"R\\\" word is the fact that another party who had booked in advance had what seemed like very different treatment. Overall the feeling I have about The Yard can be summed up in one word: icky. I get a pit in my stomach thinking about my experience there.  \\n\\nI expected much, much more from a Fox concept, having been to many of their other restaurants including the sadly defunct Bloom in the Phoenix area. The Yard is not a place I would go back to of my own volition. Dial down the self-importance, align the overall quality of your service to the prices on your menu, and treat all your customers equally. I won't be back unless refusing makes for a socially awkward situation...and then I'm ordering the cheapest thing on the menu and drinking water."}

I ordered cocktail and started to drink it. I was about a quarter of the way through and notice a bug (appeared to be a tiny spider) in it. The next time the waiter came over I showed him. All he did was lift up the glass and said yeah there's a spider. Now, I did not expect anything in return except an apology. I figured he would tell his manager about it but no. Obviously, I was not charged for the drink. I do have a photo of it but will not post it on here. I am just not a fan."}

They work hard here, dishing out awesome meals.\\n\\nThe food will not disappoint anyone.  The pickiest eater can find something  that will please them.  There are over 20 delicious pasties, many without meat.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes abit to get your food, but the wait is worth it!\\n\\nI usually go with my wife.  We like to sit near the bar at the patio doors.  I usually order the Greek pastie with an order of roasted potatoes, which I wash down with a Four Peaks Kilt Lifter beer (my fav!).  When you order the Greek, they give you little containers of tzatziki sauce  and some other sauce (which I am not fond of).\\n\\nThis is an especially awesome place to go to when it is really cold out as they use these huge ovens inside to bake your food, and it is really nice and toasty there.\\n\\nIn the summer, they have two patios to enjoy the fresh air.\\n\\nSo remember if you want a meal that is different, filling and comfortable at a decent price, this is the place to go.\\n\\nThere is another location in Tempe, but I have not been there yet."}

I wasn't in the mood to complain so I just asked for a glass of water when I ordered the USA torta. The USA torta has breaded chicken, ham, pineapple, melted cheese, and chipotle mayo.

{"label":2,"text":"Location: Mile End... you'll either need to drive and pray for a parking spot on the way there, or use public transit. \\n\\nThe place: Pretty cool - they had some funky art happening on the main wall by the window that I liked. The place has a pretty relaxed feel to it and there's lots of yellow. Or maybe it's beige... Something like that. Anyway, the vibe is chill. In terms of clientele, there was a good mix of people but sadly, I couldn't complain about the Hipsters taking over the place. Not yet, anyway - I'm sure that's temporary. You'll find people of all ages and dress codes with no pretense whatsoever. \\n\\nThe food: They have a pretty varied menu and I was in one of those moods where I didn't feel like reading so I skipped right to the omelets. These are build-your-own and all you need to do is select three ingredients and voil\\u00e0 - you're done. I went for caramelized onions, wild mushrooms and breakfast sausage because I was feeling a little meaty. My omelet arrived, piping hot, with a side of potatoes and fruit. I enjoyed the omelet very much; it was nice and fat and had the perfect mixture of ingredients - not too much or too little of one ingredient over another.  The potatoes left me feeling indifferent, however. They were crispy on the outside, which I like, but the inside was very dry so I suspect they were over-cooked. Additionally, they were sorely lacking in flavor. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and loved them. Apparently their specialty is chicken and waffles so I'd like to try that out. I really had to fight back the urge to pull a Bill Murray and grab a waffle out of my neighbor's plate - them waffles looked REAL good!\\n\\nService: Pretty good. We were greeted upon entering and they prepared a table for us very quickly. There did seem to be a lot of employees floating around the place - I constantly felt like I was surrounded by waiters.\\n\\nOverall, I liked this place and would return. The only downside was where we were sitting - right by the door. Every time someone came in, we felt the cold draft, and people sort of piled up right behind me. The up side is that we were right by the window, so there was a lot of natural light."}

{"label":0,"text":"I called this company solely based on a Yelp review. I wanted to spend my money in the community. I had friends coming in from Hawaii, and needed a yard 'clean up'. I called and scheduled an estimate day. The owner, Jason, came to the house and couldn't have been nicer. Very pleasant. I told him I needed the back yard completely raked, the river rocks cleaned out and some of them re-set because the \\u00bc- washes in during heavy rains. Depending upon the estimate, I said I'd also consider having the front yard raked and cleaned. He said he'd have Laura call me back with an estimate and options for scheduling. I thought that was kinda odd, given he's the owner and certainly knows how much he would charge to do something. Anyway, a half hour later, I got a VM from Laura saying they wouldn't be able to service my property because there wasn't enough work for the crew - and that the minimum charge would exceed the actual cost of the work. WHAT? I've had this done before and it wasn't a 'small' fee.  Quite honestly, I think the job was deemed somewhat a pain and the company didn't want to do it. Reading the company's statement of services at the bottom of their Yelp page, I can say it's not accurate."}

{"label":1,"text":"I see so many 4-5 star reviews for this place, but after trying so many menu items, it has to be about the burgers and my experience was particularly bland.  One of my friends and his girlfriend were raving about this place, since they came the previous month and told me that I had to come try it for myself.  We had the following:\\n\\n**Jalapeno Poppers: Now these are legitimately awesome, and would get them on their own.  Great taste, not to spicy and a perfect sauce.  \\n\\n**Fries (Truffle Parmesan\/Sweet Potato\/Regular): These were all delicious, as was their accompanying sauces. \\n\\n**Hells Kitchen Burger: So shouldn't this be the main event?  I was anxiously awaiting some crazy taste bud exploding moment of ecstasy that never came.  The meat was bland, the cheese didn't have much of a taste and I never felt like I tasted the peppers.  I did get it medium, so I was surprised that it was so devoid of flavors.  What happened to this supposedly insane burger?\\n\\nService wasn't good.  After we ordered, the waiter mentioned that since the burgers taken 30-45 minutes to make, we might want to think about some appetizers.  Great, thanks for letting us know.  We ordered three (3) appetizers, and they came out about 25 minutes later.  3-4 minutes after that all our burgers came out.  So much for getting appetizers to hold us over for our meal. We all had suspicions that our tab was intentionally  raised, but whatever.  \\n\\nSince we had players cards, we had a small discount on the food, which amounted to about $20.  He forgot to apply it, and he said he would after he ran our credit\/debit cards.  He \\\"forgot\\\" yet again, until I explained to him that he had not ran our players card discount.  He did finally corrected it, but after I spotted it twice.  My party felt like he was doing way too many things on \\\"purpose\\\" to forget to apply the discount.  \\n\\nThe funny thing is that I did not want to say anything about my experience at BurGR with my friends since one of them really wanted us to go try it out.  It wasn't until we went to Fat Burger right before we were heading back home that two of my friends commented on how much better Fat Burger was than BurGR, at a fraction of the price.

I rode all day long the day after I got it back and it was like a new bike! \\n\\nSince my bike ran so well after taking it to them. I gave them 3 stars. This would have been a 5 star review except for a few things. The turnaround time was longer then I expected. I called the day after taking the scooter to them and they said they found the issue and would be ordering the part from San Diego. I assumed the part would arrive in a day but took 2-3 days. Keep in mind this could have been a shipping issue, I am not 100% sure what the hold up was, but I expected to have my bike back on a Wednesday and picked it up on Friday. I dropped it off the previous Friday afternoon. \\nMy scooter is my main form of transit, so this is kind of a big deal to me. \\n\\nSecondly, when I got the bike back my back blinkers were not working. Scott rode all the way out to my place, across town in Silverado Ranch to fix this for me. I thought that was pretty awesome and it was the right thing to do. So even though I was not too thrilled with using hand signals right after getting my scooter back, they did more then make it right by coming out to me to address this. \\n\\nLastly, I was misquoted on the price. The cost of the repair was $50 more then I was originally quoted because they forgot to add the in cost of the part.

{"label":4,"text":"So far my favorite place I have eaten in Vegas. Cozy, casual, & clean environment with an eclectic menu. Grand Luxe offers a menu that is fresh & affordable that will even satisfy a wide range of tastes. The service has always been fast & efficient when I have dined here & I am looking forward to eating here later this week."}

Before I could even reply he said i keep the pricy stuff out for show.  I told him good business but im not there for the stuffed pizza so break out the plain stuff and lets roll. \\n\\nThe small slices were warm at best and didn't have much taste, but after 5 hours at a car show with no food or drink this will do."}
{"label":3,"text":"Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! \\nNow, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust......."}
{"label":3,"text":"Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over. \\n\\nPool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?\\n\\nThe only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue. \\n\\nDefinitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas."}

(It is Vegas, however, and everything is expensive, so...).   The restaurant entrance and lobby are quite nice - the wine tower makes for an eye-catching centerpiece to the main dining room.  Service has been attentive, though a bit slow paced.  We had no difficulty getting the attention of our server when I've dined here.  I suspect some people may interpret a leisurely pace as \\\"poor service.\\\"  Each time I've dined here, my server frequently came through to fill water and wine glasses, see if anything was needed, and to ensure we were enjoying our dinners.  I also found them to be very accommodating, for example, making some substitutions even though I had ordered from a prix fixe menu.   All in all, I have had good experiences here."}

{"label":2,"text":"Came here for my mom's birthday dinner because we were informed of the 4lb lobster deal for $80 that comes with two salads and two sides. We had a party of 5 and we all ordered different things, so we had a good variety to taste some of their dishes. \\n\\nFor the atmosphere, I did not really like the 1\/3 of the restaurant butting out the front entrance in the mall walkway. It just feels like your eating in a mall with just a table and chairs with people walking back and forth staring at you and your food. Luckily, we were seated like half and half from the outside and inside. I sat down at an angle where I can see a little interior and the forum shops. I kept staring at Burberry. \\n\\nFor the food, I tried the watermelon salad with the cheese in the middle of the watermelon. It was different, pretty good and I'd say worth the try. Nothing superiorly amazing that'll make me come back for though. Lobster bisque was okay, a bit towards the saltier side and not as creamy as expected. There was this shrimp dish, forgot the name, but it had Dijon mustard as part of the sauce and it was pretty good. For my entree, I had the double cut lamb chop 18oz. We also ordered sides: the asparagus fritti, goat cheese mashed potatoes, three cheese potato something, and wild mushrooms. I really enjoyed the potatoes. Cheese and potatoes? Hell yeah. Goat cheese mashed potato was different, I'd probably get that again if I came back. Asparagus fritti, no big deal. Just deep fried asparagus but the sauce with it is not bad. Wild mushrooms are no big deal. As for my lamb, it was juicy, fat, and pretty good. \\n\\nMy mom got a cheesecake, whoop happy birthday mom, comped by the restaurant, and it was like your typical cheesecake. Thank you though ! The staff was really friendly. I enjoyed their kindness and happy-go attitude. \\n\\nOh and eat the bread. That shiet was addicting."}

We went to the front desk , got our keys and told us that we could call around checkin time to find out our room # that way we didn't have to stand in line at the front desk again. Reason why I did t give them 5 stars: we called around 3 to get our room # where the guy was rude and told us the \\\"main tower\\\". Walked around for 45 minutes trying to find our room!! Come to find out we were in the grand tower. The hotel is too big with disappearing signs. Our room was amazing as we booked a suite. Housekeeping always kept it extremely clean.

It was a bit loud and chaotic when we got there--which is probably to be expected on a busy Friday in Vegas.\\n\\nI started with the Cereal Bowl--an incredible vanilla milkshake with vanilla vodka and CAPTAIN CRUNCH mixed in--awesome--though not super potent from an alcohol standpoint.\\n\\nI had the Hen House burger--which is a burger with bacon and fried egg on top, and I added American cheese.  The burger was fantastic, cooked to order, and served with seasoned steak fries which were a bit dull compared with the rest of the food (you can order shoestring fries instead).  As said in another review--the juiciness of the burger definitely soaked the bottom bun making it a bit unappetizing.\\n\\nFrom a service standpoint we were seated immediately, and then there was some confusion as one server took our drink order--which took about 10 minutes to fill, and another server then took over.   After that the server was quite attentive despite being very busy.\\n\\nThough not a cheap restaurant--Holsteins was reasonably priced for this part of the strip.

{"label":3,"text":"I am Yelping this place out of the sheer fact that the Vegas community needs some help as far as finding good services (which I'm sure there are, just not any reviewed so far on Yelp).\\n\\nSo our situation was that our supply of clean clothes were running out and we definitely needed to do a load of laundry. What's a beleaguered tourist\/visitor to do? Pay outrageous laundry prices to the hotel we're staying at to do our laundry? NO. Find a laundromat to take our laundry to and wait 2-3 hours? NO. What we stumbled upon was a pretty good compromise . . . a \\\"Wash & Fold\\\" service. Basically what \\\"Wash & Fold\\\" service is you take your dirty clothes somewhere, drop them off, and they clean and fold them for you. It's like the perfect middle ground. So what does any good Yelper do when he or she needs to find a reliable place, we go to the community.\\n\\nI did a search on Yelp but nothing really turned up, just stuff for dry cleaning and laundromats. No mention at all of \\\"Wash & Fold.\\\" So we had to do a little online research as to where we could go for a good \\\"Wash & Fold\\\" service . . . which is how we came upon Wizard of Suds.\\n\\nLocated off the Strip, just past the Palms and next to a kart racing course, you can easily miss Wizard of Suds. It's actually a laundromat combined with a convenience store as you walk into one side, start your laundry, then walk to the other side and buy a drink, snacks, or magazine. From outside, and even inside, it looks a little ghetto and shabby. However, what they lack in looks, they make up in service.\\n\\nSince it was the late afternoon, the \\\"Wash & Fold\\\" service section was closed, however there was a note on the door indicating if we wanted \\\"Fluff and Fold\\\" service to go to the convenience store register. Apparently the \\\"Wash & Fold\\\" area is staffed with 3-4 people during the day, but only one at night. Hence, more clothes get done during the day than at night. So the guy told us that they could take our clothes but that they wouldn't be ready till lunchtime the next day.\\n\\nWe were fine with this as we figured it was going to be next day service anyway. So we gave them our clothes and our contact info and information and they told us to come back the next day. How it works is that they charge you a per pound rate with a 10 lbs minimum. Sure enough when we returned the next day they had our clothes for us washed and folded. Total cost around $16. I'm not exactly sure how much clothes we had, but it was approximately 1.5 loads of clothing. \\n\\nNothing went wrong with our load, but that's not to say that things can't go wrong. When we returned to our hotel we checked our clothes and actually found that we had more clothes than what we dropped off. Apparently another t-shirt got mixed into our batch of clothes so someone in Vegas is missing their shirt. Whether it was a load mix up or perhaps just fell off another pile is hard to say, but I would recommend that you don't take in any vital articles of clothing if you elect to do this.\\n\\nOverall though, I thought it was a great service, fast, pretty reliable, and fairly priced. Don't be deterred by the look of the store though."}

{"label":3,"text":"I went to Le Cirque with insane expectations.  Being only my second dinner at the Bellagio, the previous one at the amazing Picasso, I had anticipated this dinner quite a bit.  In the end, I was disappointed.\\n\\nWe went in a party of 7.  When we sat down, menus were provided, but we knew immediately we were doing the tasting menu.  We raised some special needs with our waiter, and he provided several possible substitutions for certain dishes that did not fit the constraints.   He suggested a truffle rosotto over the scallop and mushroom.  Instead of john dory, how about rabbit, or chicken (really?), or filet?  \\n\\nWith the menu decided, bread was served.  The bread was excellent.  There were three or four different breads in each basket.  The highlight was something I've never seen before: fat, soft pretzel bread.  It was like having a soft pretzel in bread form.  It was great.\\n\\nThe first course was a lobster salad, but I don't eat shellfish.  Instead, I was given a nicely presented traditional salad.  It was okay.  Nothing very exciting, though the tomatoes were excellent.\\n\\nThe second course was a sauteed foie gras with dried fruits and hazelnut.  A classic combination, again, tried but true. This was excellent, though I think I've had enough foie gras for a couple years from this one dish alone -- it was not lacking in quantity.  \\n\\nThe next course was the risotto.  Again, the menu called for a scallop and mushroom, but I opted for a truffle risotto.  Boy, did it have truffles.  The entire mini sauce pan in which it was served was covered with large flakes of truffle.  I've never seen that much in one place.  The risotto was good.  The truffle tasted like nothing.  Yes, there was enough truffle to take many bites of just truffle.  I simply didn't understand it.  I suppose truffle is best appreciated through the nose. Other members of my party who ordered the scallop rosotto preferred theirs over the one with truffle. \\n\\nThe next dish was the jon dorry.  It was fine.  Interestingly, it was served with a red wine sauce, which I do need to give the chef props for.  That was unique to my experience.\\n\\nThen, the lamb.  I am having a hard time remembering it, again.  The waiter did not ask for our temperature preference, and as such everyone's came our medium\/medium well.  That alone was not so impressive.  I do recall that it was the cleanest frenching I've ever seen on a chop, though.\\n\\nWith all the courses over, our waiter asked us if we'd like dessert.  We say yes, order some coffees, and by the time the coffee is served, the waiters all come out with 7 different desserts prepared, one for each person (a surprise!).  We played a game of Pass the Dessert and got to try them all.  Each was quite large.  The best was probably a coconut\/mango ice cream served in a coconut.  Other offerings included two souffles, a strawberry shortcake, and others.  On top, we were provided petit fours.  Again, nothing truly amazing.\\n\\nIn all, I found the food pretty generic.  It was solid, no doubt, but not creative.  Nothing elicited a \\\"wow\\\" except, perhaps, some of the portions.  I feel like the kitchen was playing it safe with this menu.\\n\\nI must compare this restaurant to Picasso.  The experience pales in comparison.  Add on top of that that the menu is $145 per person ($40-$50 more than Picasso) and then another $14 per person for the truffle substitution (and for what, exactly?), and one wonders what the value proposition here is.  \\n\\nPerhaps my anticipation got the better of me, but in all, I can't fully recommend this restaurant.  I think there are better choices out there."}

The waitress, whose name was probably Betty Lou or Bobbi Jo (and sounded like it), was the biggest ray of sunshine in the otherwise desolate place. She was very nice and attentive. She engaged in lively conversation and was all peppy and shit. I was kinda hung over so I just wanted by breakfast.\\n\\nThe only other people there were the Asian owners who were taking down their very Eastern Christmas decorations.\\n\\nThe menu is your typical American breakfast food fare; pancakes, waffles, grits, biscuits, eggs, all sorts of hog parts and whatnot. I ordered a standard egg, pancake and bacon plate and a sausage biscuit on the site. The food was good, nothing exciting, except for the country ham... which tasted like I'd just popped a gram of salt in my mouth, but Becky likes it.\\n\\nThe biggest gripe was how long it took for our freakin' food to arrive. It took roughly about 20 minutes for us to get our food. I assumed the Asian man was too busy taking down the Xmas decorations and hadn't even started the pancake batter that morning.\\n\\nOn our way out there was a funny side on the register that said, \\\"Do you want to talk to the man in charge, or the woman who knows what is going on\\\". That sign alone gave them the third star.\\n\\nThat's it... pretty generic stuff."}

{"label":2,"text":"When reading one of Vegas's local magazine, I happened across a food review that touted Phat Phrank's as having the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIn my youth, consumption of Mexican food in Vegas was usually only done after indulging of some non-alcoholic Roy Rogers and Shirley Temples on the Strip (extra grenadine of course :P ). In those days, I would be willing to wager that you could have fried a shoe and it probably would have tasted good to me. \\n\\nBut this article indicated that Phat Phrank's was pretty darn good and I was craving some carne asada so... \\n\\nI arrived at about 12 pm on a Thursday and the place was hopping. A line of about 7 people quickly formed, which gave me some time to peruse a laminated menu for what I wanted to eat. I settled on a carne asada burrito with a drink for about 7 dollars. Frank gave me a number, and told me to pick a seat and they would bring my food out to me. About 3-4 minutes passed and a reasonable sized carne asada burrito was delivered to me. \\n\\nStand by for carne asada burrito dissection...\\n\\nTortilla - This was ok - had the consistency of a whole wheat tortilla (a bit harder).  \\n\\nCarne Asada - While this was seasoned appropriately, I was a bit disappointed at how much of the Carne was too fat to eat...I'm used to a little bit here and there, but about a 1\/4 of my burrito was annoyingly fatty. \\n\\nBeans - Beans were flavor-fully non-offensive and didn't take away from the meat thankfully. \\n\\nSo all in all, Phat Phranks's was Phrankly ok. The reviews on Yelp make me think that maybe that was just a bad burrito day for Frank and his family. Unfortunately, I have yet to try Mexican food outside of California that is worth a repeat trip, but I'm willing to go back to Phrank's and try something else next time I am in Vegas to see if I feel any differently."}

{"label":1,"text":"very blah food.. The gumbo was decent. the truffle mac and cheese was ok, but lacked salt. I ordered the salmon and specifically told the waiter that I wanted it close to rare, but the salmon that was brought out was well done. I can understand if you cannot cook the salmon rare.. but if u are telling me that you can, you better bring it out rare. my friend had the porchatta - said that it was ok, but felt like spam. overall, very blah food."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not great, but not terrible either. We'd heard good things from a friend, and went in pretty optimistic. The restaurant itself is typical sports bar- lots of tvs, full bar, etc.\\n\\nBut, after receiving our menus we were disappointed to discover the first 2 things we tried to order were not available. They stopped serving curly fries (but hadn't updated their menu), and were somehow out of the appetizer we wanted. Blah! The wings my husband ordered were ok, but unremarkable. I got their gyro sandwich for something different, and it was pretty good.\\n\\nOverall I left the place with mixed feelings. I may go back and give them another shot, but I'm not in any hurry to eat there again."}

{"label":0,"text":"THE FAIR AND REAL DEAL: After reading reviews about Flagstone, the staff at the leasing office persuaded me that the reviews were untrue and this was a great place to live. So unfortunately, I decided to move in. I moved into a Studio apartment, which was disgusting. Stained mirrors, stained carpet, stained cabinets. It was a disaster. To be fair, I chose to rent a regular Studio apartment instead of a \\\"Deluxe Studio\\\" which was more expensive. When I moved in, no one told me about the laundry policy and it was not written in the lease anywhere. So the first weekend I moved in, I threw all my laundry in two washing machines doused with laundry detergent and fabric softener to find out that the laundry machines do not take any money, you have to buy a laundry card. Here's the most bizarre part: you can ONLY purchase a laundry card with a 5 dollar bill. It has to be a 5 dollar bill. No 5 $1 bills, you can't use a credit card, and you can't use anything higher than a $5 bill. The rule is stupid, but I wouldn't have been mad if someone told me this when I moved in. Instead, I had to take my detergent soaked clothes out of the machines and back to my apartment because the leasing office was closing and that is where you much purchase your laundry card. Next, I have now been locked INSIDE of the pool area FOUR different times in the last 6 weeks because the gate jams and the gate that actually works has a lock on it (which I have asked multiple times for them to remove it but they haven't). Every time I had to call the leasing office to get me out. Thankfully there were open because none of my neighbors cared enough to help me get out. Two times when I spoke with Erica people came right away, even she came to bail me out herself (Erica is the only person who is helpful in the office). The other two times, the leasing agent to me I had to wait. Once because \\\"the staff was on a lunch break\\\" and the other time because \\\"the staff was busy.\\\" So I stood waiting a good 20 minutes to get out. I felt like an animal trapped in a cage. Now for the biggest complaint, a few days ago we were given a notice that \\\"AC IS NO LONGER AN OPTION.\\\" That's right, they have completely turned air conditioning off. It is still 72 degrees outside. Last night I turned my ceiling fan on the highest it could go, bought fans to keep me cool, but I still woke up in a sweat. It was miserable. If you choose to live here you will also frequently receive notices about the water being shut off all day. The funny thing is that they will give you a notice at 11:00am that the water is being shut off at 10:00am-7:00pm. Thanks for the heads up. My last biggest complaint is about the electricity. When I heard you pay a \\\"flat electricity rate\\\" I thought that's great! Here's the thing, the lights are motion censored and will turn off, but not on. The biggest fear is the motion censored bathroom light. When you are taking a bath or a shower, the light with randomly turn off. This is a safety hazard and significantly inconvenient. I have already taken a few slips from not being able to see. To be fair, I will list pros about these apartments. The complex is for the most part, very quiet and peaceful. I haven't had any complaints about loud neighbors or any loud parties. The community seems to be filled with people who go to work and come home to rest. The quiet makes for a peaceful setting. Also, the landscaping is beautiful and is kept up very well. The trees that surround the complex makes for beautiful scenery. Also, the grounds are kept clean and tidy. I have yet to see anyone not pick up after their dog, and there is no trash or cigarette butts laying around. To a friend, I would not recommend living here. But if you want something cheap and don't care about what I have mentioned above, then this is the place for you. P.S. The pools are NOT open 24 hours as listed on websites."}

{"label":3,"text":"You gotta be hip to be SQUARE.\\n\\nWhat a cool idea to have their ice cream in a square instead of round.  This is so helpful in so many ways.....\\n\\na.

There are so many flavors, I cannot tell you all, but the texture is rich and creamy, the taste is awesome, the quality is like Ben and Jerry compared to a generic brand. \\n\\nb.

Boo Hoo when it is over 100.  you come here to cool off and then you heat back up!\\n\\nc.  Ambiance - 4 star - The place is a long rectangle, which is great for long lines. However it is not inviting at all for sitting and eating inside. Just a bit \\\"cold\\\" or lacking character.\\n\\nIf you love ice cream and want a treat this  is the place to go!\\n\\nIF you want an even more unique experience, and want a crepe with your ice cream, drive a few miles south to Crepe Shack and Waffle on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the KMart Sears area.  This is a great place for Thrifty ice cream in a crepe with fruit.  Totally Yummy."}
{"label":2,"text":"First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. \\n\\nAs for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w\/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney\/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.\\n\\nAll in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.\\n\\n** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food\/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate. \\n\\nAgain, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!"}

{"label":3,"text":"I stopped here for lunch while visiting friends over the weekend.  I've been here many times years ago when I lived in Goodyear Az and always had a good experience but this time was only mediocre.\\n\\nThe art and food festival was going on down old litchfield road which brought out a ton of people.  Surprisingly, there was an open table on the patio though and we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was very crowded though and it took almost an hour and a half to get our food after we ordered.  I got the enchiladas suizas which are usually very good but this time mine were only luke warm at best.  No one else at the table complained.  The chips and salsa were good as well, they bring out two types (a spicy one and a milder chunky one).\\n\\nOverall, this is a decent mexican restaurant (probably the best one in Goodyear).  They have good food and it is in a nice scenic part of town tucked away in old litchfield park.  They also have a full bar but I think their margaritas are a little too sweet."}
{"label":1,"text":"So I'm a huge fan of supporting local businesses and on a lazy Sunday, I drove past the Dunkin and the Starbucks, excited to try Beanz Coffee Cafe after seeing it many times. First thoughts? All this seating doesn't really exist. There is so much negative space outside--why not capitalize with a few cafe tables? And there's just a big gaping space in the center where there should be tables for two; if there were a long line, I could see it making sense, but there wasn't so it made how empty this place was so much more obvious. \\n\\nFirst glance at the menu, this is clearly a shop for people who like some coffee with their sugar. Lots of flavor syrups and unique lattes for a sugary concoction with a small dose of java. But that's OK--different strokes for different folks--and maybe that's the ticket to a delightful coffee beverage at Beanz. \\n\\nI, on the otherhand, opted for an Americano which I thought would be a safe bet but boy was I wrong. Watery espresso with no crema--none. I can make better drip coffee at home. For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed. \\n\\nBut maybe my breakfast sandwich would be better? Don't even bother. The bagels, I swear, are Thomas's from the bag. I've had better bagels from the grocery store. The eggs were microwaved (gross) and the cheese was just processed yellow Kraft Singles. \\n\\nOne word? Avoid. This place was such a disappointment. I certainly won't be returning."}

My wife and I order all you can eat sushi, we told the waiter which rolls we wanted to eat first that order took twenty minutes to arrive at my table. When we finished that order we had to ask a bus person to hunt down are waiters to place another order of sushi.

{"label":4,"text":"I recommend Sonoma Grille without reservation.  I have, as of this review, eaten lunch there three times, and each time the food has been amazing, the prices have been extremely reasonable, the portions have been just right, the meals have come out fresh and staggeringly quickly, and the wait staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  The decor is gorgeous, the tables are neither too close to nor too far from one another (there's plenty of seating away from the bar), and it really is, TARDIS-like, bigger on the inside.  \\n\\nNow, normally, I like to recommend particular dishes.  I'll do that here, but understand that the Sonoma Grille menu changes with some frequency (it has done so once since the first time I ate there about six weeks ago).  If these things are still on the menu, I recommend the Pittsburgh Chopped Salad (so named, I believe, because of the crispy shoestring potatoes on top of it), the Amish Chicken Breast with fetuccine, the panko fried shrimp appetizer (which is what popcorn shrimp wants to be when it grows up - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spiced to perfection), and the sweet & spicy salad.  You can add a protein to any of the salads - for the PGH salad, I added salmon, and for the sweet & spicy one, I added chicken breast.  \\n\\nEvery time I've eaten there, I've been blown away.

I must admit it did not live up to its 'reputation'. For our first soir\\u00e9e, there we had brunch, and it turned out GREAT! My wife had the short rib hash (poached egg, horseradish hollandaise) @ around $12-14 it was priced right and tasted good.

The burger was red and spewed blood necessitating its return to the kitchen. Upon its return the meat was still a shade of pink that prompted my wife to throw in the towel and admit defeat.

Once we were seated, we waited fifteen minutes before I had to seek out our waitress. Because of this, the manager treated each of us to a drink.

The people I went with said their regular burgers (I think they ordered the kobe beef) were the best burgers they ever had so I will definitely come back here again to try one of their regular sized ones.

I was charged 40 bucks for them to install a bike computer(the mounting was already in place) and it took them ten minutes and three zip ties. and even more recently, i went in for brake work, and they said they were going to do an entire brake job and they were going to replace all of the brake cable housings. when i got it back, i realized that they had only replaced two of them, but bumped up to cost of each so it was still the same ammount of money. \\n\\nit is sad that this place is now about profit versus genuine customer service, and for that reason, i will be taking my bike elsewhere, (slippery pig, etc)"}

Chipotle, Food4Less, and other popular diners\/cafes are located within walking distance. \\n\\nI have roomed here almost every time I visit Vegas. The rooms are extremely well-kept, with earthy furnishings and modern accents... I wouldn't call it anything like home, but why else am I on vacation? I don't want to feel as though I'm home!\\n\\nI recall the pool was quite roomy; when I used to swim often, I loved that it wasn't a kiddie pool I could swim across in six seconds or so. The slide is definitely appropriate for older children, though. \\n\\nThe \\\"adults only\\\" gameroom is open to children as long as they look somewhat responsible...

{"label":0,"text":"This review is not so much for this location but the parent company, Foodmaker Inc. Headquartered in San Diego, CA. \\nSeveral years ago a manager at this location presented me with a special card that had no expiration, and entitled me to free combos, or other types of food. It seemed ironic to receive this gift after a short conversation with the manager,as I'm from San Diego and have been a big fan of Jacks since they were a local San Diego chain. It's almost as if I'm being rewarded for 50 years of brand loyalty. Several months ago this card was taken from me by someone at this location, he informed that their was a mistake, and that he needed to confiscate the card. I reluctantly handed it over, not wishing to cause a problem in the restaurant. I notified Foodmaker via e-mail about this and all they did was send me a form letter back, never contacting me personally. My girlfriend experienced a problem at the A&W next door, and not only did they personally contact her, but sent her 2 \\\"Be Our Guest\\\" cards, allowing her to have 2 free combos at any A&W store. Problem corrected in 8 days! After waiting another month, I again contacted Foodmaker asking for some sort of explanation, again the exact same form letter, with no personal contact. So thanks for nothing Foodmaker, after 50 years I'll be taking my business to A&W and In&Out."}

{"label":3,"text":"I'm confused as to why this place doesn't get better reviews from Yelpers.  I travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year.  We usually stay here when our time share allows.  This time, there was no availability, so we paid out of pocket...and still feel it was worth it.\\n\\nAs already noted by other yelpers, the great qualities about this hotel are the location, convenience of the kitchen, friendliness of staff, available parking, strong wifi in room (particularly 2nd and 3rd floor)...I'm not sure what else to add.  Toiletries are bath and body works, good pressure and instant warm water in the shower, thick towels...It's great that they provide a small vacuum cleaner in the closet so you're not reliant on housekeeping.  I can't really think of any cons that are really the hotel's fault.  So LV Blvd and Koval, which are the two main roads that border the hotel are made congested.  LV at almost all times, and Koval during peak hours.  Another con is no airport shuttle.  But I usually have a car when I visit LAS.\\n\\nI think the price of $120 a night (incl taxes and fees) is reasonable.  It's not the cheapest even on the Strip (Circus Circus, Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood, and Imperial Palace are a few I know that are cheaper...but I wouldn't want to stay at any of them).\\n\\nFinal note, one yelper's review suggested that it was a con that this was not an actual casino hotel.  In Vegas you can gamble at convenience stores, grocers, and even right before you leave at the airport.  If not having a casino immediately accessible first thing when you crawl out of bed makes your palms itch...then you might have a problem;)"}

Even the fries which would normally be \\\"chips\\\" were delish.  Also ordered the salmon after reading the good reviews on it and my BF liked it alot, I thought it was too overly sweet.  Caesar salad was good, but unremarkable.  Just romaine, croutons and dressing, not much to say about it.  Service was good last nite, too, although I could have used a couple more refills of my iced tea.  We were a table of six and everyone's food came out at the same time, so kudos to the wait staff\/kitchen staff on that one!  Like others have said, the guy calling out the trivia questions just cannot be heard and we were really close to him!  They need to invest in a better sound system or something so us old farts can hear the questions better.  All in all, I am giving it 4 stars today, which is about 2 more than they would have earned from me in all the previous visits there.  Try the fish and chips!"}

No big deal, I mean the server didn't ask and we didn't specify, so really no love lost there, just an observation.

But whatevs, all looks the same in the end right?\\nThe barbecue sauce used on the pork for the appetizer was too vinegary.  The pork was fine, the corn cakes were ok.  Like the presentation the dish was lackluster.\\nSame with the pizza.  We have had goat cheese and fig pizzas elsewhere and this one failed to compete.  The blobs of goat cheese were a little gamey for my liking, and rather than use actual figs they chose an overly tart spread, again in globs.

There is a TV that was on the Cooking channel when I was in with subtitles.  \\n\\nFriendly tip - your breath is going to be WHEEEEYEW from all of the deliciousness, so I wouldn't do this for a first date (or third, *wink*) or before a trip to your dentist (unless you hate your dentist), but any other time would be fabulous.\\n\\nGreat little spot, the owner and his staff are incredible and definitely made a great impression.  Come for the friendliness, stay for the food, I can't wait to go back and try some more food."}

We have inquired is possible to check in prior noon is the gentlemen was nice enough to accomodate us. We had the breakfast buffet. The servers was really outstanding.

The guy with the glasses that served us was super attentive and sweet, made sure we were takin care of. I ordered a BLT sandwich and some fries and my boyfriend ordered a burger and a salad. He said he really liked his meal even though his burger looked a little strange to him. His salad was delicious, I ate more of it than he did. My BLT was kind of gross, chewy, nasty bacon and the bread hurt my mouth. The fries were good, ate them all. Maybe I just need to try something different next time I go here. A lot of people seem to love this place and I want to make sure I try it again. Oh and the beer on tap was kind of expensive."}

I personally would have done a mix of mozz and goat cheese but, hey, I'm not the chef.\\n-- Chopped salad was okay...chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olive, and feta in a nice, light dressing\\n-- Pasta alla vodka...highly recommended! tortellini stuffed with ricotta in a spicy tomato cream sauce, with basil, crispy prosciutto, and garlic for that special added kick of flavor that makes this dish unique\\n-- Chicken limone...your standard picatta, but with two huge breasts of chicken and a side of yummy pasta (although the pasta was a little cold)\\n-- \\\"Dolchinos\\\"...small servings of desserts...we tried the key lime pie, which was yummy, but it was the bananas foster creme brulee that evoked a WOW!\\nAll-in-all, I'm very pleasantly surprised by this chain restaurant.

We showed up and got seated right away. Very small, quiet place. All the employees were very nice and our server was very helpful with suggestions. There were 5 of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share. This dish I chose was the lamb masala! AMAZING!! Very sweet\/spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable. Overall great experience and will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet!"}

{"label":0,"text":"I hate to give any business a one star rating, particularly if the staff has been friendly,  but the quality of the food here is pretty bad.\\n\\nMe and my partner went for dinner the week before Christmas.\\n\\nWe were in town for a week.  This was the worst meal we had.\\n\\nWaiter was very enthusiastic.  There were no service problems.  The hostess out front was charming.\\n\\nPartner had the oysters.   He's quite the oyster eater, almost always ordering them in any seafood place.  He says they were among the worst he's had.  By and large for him it was a temperature thing.  Oysters are far better if they are really cold.  Some of his were pretty much room temperature.\\n\\nI had the calamari appetizer. It was piping hot, if somewhat bland.  Large chunks of calamari, in a very light and tasteless batter.\\n\\nHe had the fish and chips entree.  I had the bacon-wrapped scallops.\\n\\nHis was, as he put it, frozen Mrs. Pauls fish stick quality.  Bland.  Unfresh (if that's a word).  \\n\\nMy scallops were possibly the saltiest things I've ever put in my mouth.   And they had a slightly funky 'maybe they sat out all day' sortof taste.   The side vegetables were overcooked and bland.\\n\\nThe bathroom is pretty dirty.  A dirty bathroom in a seafood restaurant doesn't instill much confidence.\\n\\nI honestly wouldn't have been surprised to wake up the next day with food poisoning.\\n\\nDinner for two (no drinks) was around $70.  FAR too much for substandard seafood. \\n\\nIn a normal mall in a normal city maybe you'd just say 'eh' and consider it a lesson learned.\\n\\nBut this is Vegas, with literally unlimited dining choices.\\n\\nYou can do far, far better.  \\n\\nThe funny thing is, when we sat down we had an uneasy feeling about the place, so we checked the Yelp reviews.  But we didn't heed them.  Our mistake.\\n\\nRight down the corridor is Pampass, the Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse.  I didn't get a chance to try it, as I opted for Oyster Bay instead.  I regret that choice.  If you are reading this review outside Oyster Bay, check out Pampass instead."}

{"label":3,"text":"3.5 stars, but I'll round up.  \\n\\nWhile I do consider myself somewhat of a foodie, I normally don't seek out the tv popular chefs' places.  However, I have enjoyed Batali's work at the two Mozzas in LA and I enjoyed a few dishes at Carnevino in the Palazzo.  Truth be told though, the real reason we came is is for one dish: Cacio e Pepe.  This simple pasta dish-- which consists of pasta, premium olive oil, cheese, and pepper--was one of my very favorite dishes when I traveled to Italy, and I've never seen it anywhere here in the US.  We had to try it out.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is situated in the Venetian's \\\"St Mark's Square,\\\" which is, as many have said, super touristy and not even remotely like Piazza San Marco in Venice.  We grabbed a seat in the outside portion of the restaurant, which was nice since there was a wonderful string quartet playing beautifully.  \\n\\nOn to the food:\\n-The bread is mediocre, but the olive oil and balsamic vinegar (upon request) is tasty.\\n-Sampled the Grand Tasting of the Carne: Prosciutto, Salumi, Mortadella, Testa, and Coppa.  The quality of the meat was outstanding.  Very good prosciutto (the only meat not made in house), and surprisingly good Mortadella; the best my husband has ever had, he says.\\n-Hubby ordered the Bucatini Amatriciana (which we've sampled at Carnevino too); it was decent, but Carnevino does a better job.\\n-I ordered my Cacio e Pepe; It needed a little more oil, more cacio and more pepe.  I asked the server for some, which h brought.  But, had it been added when it was prepared, the cheese would've melted a bit and the dish would've been infinitely better.  It was just ok.  \\n-All of the dishes went nicely with the well-priced bottle of chianti we shared.  The place makes a good espresso as well.\\n\\nI enjoyed our meal here, although my incredibly high expectations\/desires for my cacio e pepe may taint my review a bit.  I wouldn't go here expecting the most gourmet food or the elegant setting.  But, the atmosphere was festive, the food was solid, and the service was good."}

The bathroom was well stocked and good sized with that super curved shower curtain rail I keep meaning to get for my own home.\\n\\nThe room was quiet and clean with little noise from the neighbors or the hallway.

Check in didnt take long, dude was ok. It took forever to get our bags though. The casino reeks of smoke. Pee-youuuu.\\n\\nMy room was on floor 7, tower one.

{"label":0,"text":"LADIES BEWARE..\\n\\nIf you're an out of towner and want to die, stay here.  My gf and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan during a visit to LV for my bday and upgraded to a suite, with balcony, upon arrival.  The room was nicely decorated but dirty.  The bathroom had white stains all over the marbletopped counter and there was dust all over the paintings\/fixtures in the room.  We cleaned the dust off with towels and used lysol wipes (yeah me for packing them!!) to disinfect the bathroom before getting ready to head out.  After returning to our room around 3am, we fell out but were awakened by someone banging on our room door.  Thinking some sort of emergency situation was going on, we jumped out of bed and ran to look out the keyhole to find a BEYOND DRUNK man going to town on the door.  We called the front desk and asked that he be removed, however 15 minutes went by, STILL NO SECURITY.  Afraid and exhausted, we tried to reason with the gentleman who now had his pinky finger in his mouth and seemed to be rubbing his lower body with his other hand.  He continued banging and then had the audacity to put his eye up to the peephole, trying to see into our room.  We called the front desk again and were told that security was not on site and that we simply had to wait.  There was nothing they were able or really going to do until the offsite security got there.  After what seemed like forever, the banging stopped and the man sat down in front of our door.  We ended up not being able to leave for a 8am excursion we purchased tickets for.  When we got to the front desk, we were connected to security who confirmed that they received the complaint and that the gentleman was removed in an indecent state from our front door.  When we asked what they meant by \\\"indecent\\\" they refused to go into detail and stated that their reasoning for not contacting us to let us know it were safe to leave the room was because they did not know how to reach us.  Umm..didn't you just say you removed him from in front of our room?! We called from the phone in our room, how were you not able to knock on the door, show your badge and let us know what was going on..wtf?!  We complained to the Manager who must have had a nice big delicious mug of BITCH for breakfast.  She basically told us she did not care since the situation was over and that it really was not any of our business as to what state the man was in when they found him.  We later filed a report with security and were told that the man - \\\"Nick\\\" was naked in front of our door and had to be restrained and removed from the floor.  He was not a guest..he was a trespasser and they had NO CLUE as to how he was able to gain access to the hotel, let alone get up to our floor without having a keycard for the elevator.  \\n\\nBE VERY CAREFUL LADIES.  The Cosmopolitan and their staff does not care about anything but getting your money, especially not your safety.  \\\"Nick\\\" and his naked behind could have raped and killed someone and they would have covered it up, I promise."}

{"label":2,"text":"Finally made it out to Great Wall for dim sum. I've been hearing so much about this place but I am hardly ever in this area so it was sitting in my \\\"to try\\\" list for quite some time. Walking in, I thought, this is gonna be legit. The place was packed to the rim with asian people waiting to get their dim sum on. The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact). \\n\\nWe didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.\\n\\nIn summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!"}

{"label":1,"text":"i also had a shady experience.  i am from sacramento and it took a couple of weeks and a fee emails to find out if they still had husky puppys.  i was finally contacted back and told yes.  we head south to san diego for christmas every year.  one the way down we told the kids we had to stop for \\\"fish\\\" for christmas.  the foster mom from moondoggies asked us to meet her at the Cerritos Mall near her work.  we waited for nearly 2 hours for her to arrive.  When she did it was a different puppy than we had originally talked about.  i was ok with that.  she told me the ones she had had been adopted the night before to a family who wanted to keep both the brother and sister together.  yeah!  so she had to get this puppy from a different foster mom.  Since i was from out of town she asked if i could pay in cash.  i did.  But because we met in a mall she couldn't give me a copy of the agreement and she said she would scan it and email it when she got home.  this happened on 12\/22\/11. She then said she would check in with week after Christmas to see how it was going.\\n\\nI had noticed that the puppy's belly was bloated.  my husband assured me that it was normal puppy bloat.  The foster mom gave me a sheet of paper that stated her vaccinations and her microchip info. she warned me that their may still be some worms in her stool because she had been given a dewormer.\\n\\nThe nest day i still had not heard from her.  i have no paperwork from her or the insurance company that i was supposedly set up with.  that night, the poor little puppy was vomiting up roundworms all night long.  i took her to Bansfield vet in petsmart since i was out of town and could not see my regular vet.  Turns out she not only had roundworms so bad but she also had giardia.  the vet also had to hydrate her.  again this is part of the rescue process and i could deal with it.  However, i had not heard back from moondoggies.   The puppy is on medicine and starting to do better.  i waited a week and eventually i posted a beware notice on moondoggies facebook page and also sent an nasty email to the info@moondoggiesrescue.com since phone calls and texts were not being returned.\\n\\nFinally i got a reponse from them.  They asked me to remove my negative post from their facebook page and that they would get me my info and that there was no way they would adopt out a sick puppy.  unfortunatly i have almost $500 in vet bills to prove that she was sick. Once back in town i took her to my regular vet.  this time the vet tried contacting the resue for more information.  two weeks have gone by at this time.  BTW, there was no microchip found in the puppy by either vet office.  Moondoggies finally sent me a copy of my aggreement, pet insurance and another sheet of vaccinations on the puppy.  the sheet they originally gave me and the new one sent to me do not match at all.  my vet has decided to start her over on all vaccinations and give her another weeks worth of medication since we were still seeing some traces of worms in her stool.  now she is much healthier and is a very happy dog.  we are so glad we rescued her.  my kids and our other dog are so happy.\\n\\ni am very doubtful i will get my spay deposit back from moondoggies.  i asked them for a refund of the cost of remicrochipping when i get her payed and they told me no.  they will find someone to meet me and get the microchipping done.  i sent them some information on reputable resues in my area.  i have not heard back form them since.  My puppy is schduled to be spayed in a month.  my vet wants to make sure she is fully healthy and her immune system is up to par before it happens.\\n\\nanyway, this has been my experience so far."}

My friend ordered the French Dip Steak and it was horrible! The meat was dryer than the Las Vegas heat, no taste! The soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting. Meanwhile I had the hamburger that had no taste to it. \\n\\nNow usually if we were paying a cheap price, you get what you pay for. But these orders were $20 bucks a piece. And I understand that it's late at night, but either lower the price or give us fresh food. We let our server know that we didn't like our food (we couldn't even finish it) and didn't want anything else. Then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and \\\"apologized\\\". Yeah, whatever dude.

Again the food was good (but my friend wasn't happy with the gravy slathered all over the chicken. The issues with slow and incorrect service remained.  It took a while to get drinks, refills were slow and incorrect. Several people came in after us and left before us. Dessert was so slow we had to cancel it. They must make each cobbler from scratch as ordered because 15 minutes later we still had no pie. An additional displeasure is the restaurant is very loud - especially on the patio.

I've also chatted up perfect strangers - frankly, that's not so unusual for me though so I won't go on.  Suffice it to say it's a friendly neighborhood joint.  Tonight's special was Burro de pastor.  A marinated and grilled pork with guacamole, pineapple, cilantro and other tasty bits.  My 3 year old, 5 year old and 45 year old husband loved them.  We also had the Vampiro which was delicious too.  A corn tortilla with the pastor pork, guacamole & caramelized onions mmmmm.  Kids also order the fail-safe quesadilla.  It's good - how bad can cheese in a flour tortilla be?  Thing is, I don't want to order quesadillas for my kids.  The last time I was there we had the carne asada--my husband and I both love it, the kids didn't love it.

Finding a 13 inch tire is hard now-a-days!  Off it was to Costco.  After a quick search, Costco came out of the gates with ONE set of tires from Michelin.  The famed Michelin Defender, their newest high-end tire.  I figured it would cost me a pretty penny since they were top of the line.  And I was right.  A darn 13 inch tire would cost me $91.50 EACH after mounting, install, tax, and fees.  About $366 for a set of four!  Wow that's expensive!  Especially for a car that I will be driving no more than 5000 miles a year (darn right Eva has a 'classic vehicle' plate).\\n\\nI told Costco I would think about it.  I've heard horror stories about their tire department service from others, and the amount of waiting time needed just to put tires on a car.  After the price quote, I was told by Costco that if I dropped my car off at the first signs of opening it would take about 2-3 hours for it to get done.  If there was someone who managed to get in front of me before my appointment, it would take 3-4 hours.  Really?  Now I'm no mechanic but I do know it shouldn't take that long to put a tire on a car, especially when you have specific equipment to handle this.\\n\\nAs a giggles experiment I called Discount Tire.  I was greeted with a warm tone, and began to speak what I needed.  Though I would be up Shi+s Creek when it came down to price because Costco is the supposed 'price leader'.  What happened surprised me.  Not only did I see they had the Michelin Defender tire that Costco had, they also had 2 other companies that made tires for my car rim.  These were also cheaper than the Michelin ones!  But, dude on the phone informed me that they're cheaper because they were rated for less miles than the Michelin ones.  The Michelin Defender tires are rated at 90k miles, which means I wouldn't have to change the tires for a LONG time with my light driving on Eva.  He also mentioned the Michelin tires have a better review rating as well.\\n\\nOther tires were out, Michelin was IN.  But, now it came down to brass tacks.  Got the quote from Discount Tire and it was much higher than Costco, like $50 higher for the set of four.  Told the guy on the phone that I would probably hit Costco instead because of the price difference.  He asked me how much they were charging me.  A pause, and a few keyboard strokes later, and dude from Discount Tire price-matched it!  Then he came down to $360 with tax just to make the number more rounded!  Told Discount Tire guy when can we schedule and I was in that next Saturday early.  \\n\\nUpon arriving, I was greeted then asked to assist with mileage on the car.  Discount Tire was like, \\\"Nice ride!  So clean!  This really an 86'?  I'll make sure on the order to tell the guys to be careful with the car.\\\"  Then he marked the order in red all over 'classic'.  Before paying, of course I was gonna be upsold.  I was prepared to say NO.  Was offered their lifetime warranty for $20 on EACH tire.  I was like, \\\"Nah, I won't do it unless the total for me is less than $400 out the door.\\\"  Discount Tire dude was like, \\\"Hmm.  Let me see.\\\"  A few button clicks later he tells me he can do $399.xx out the door.  I was on the fence.  He tells me that the lifetime warranty covers EVERYTHING on each tire, defects, warping, cracking, nails, even if it is my fault.  For the life of the tire.  Dammit, I signed up!  Comes out to less than $10 per tire for warranty.\\n\\nTidied up the bill, and sat and watched every move those tire techs did on my baby!  They really were careful, took off the rims and center caps gingerly, and went slow with removing my old tires.  Even then, the entire job was done in only 30 minutes!  No more waiting!  Great, friendly, fast, efficient, and reasonable service!  Tires were shined, and Eva was pulled out slowly to the parking lot.  All new shoes on her!  So pretty!  \\n\\nI will be back to Discount Tire for my tire needs for now.  Price-matching and service for me can't be beat.  My Eva and I thank you!  Love that new tire smell."}

I walked past many tasty looking cafes to get here, so had high hopes that it would be top notch.\\n\\nInside, it's all dark wood, rickety furniture and it has charm. It was busy, so it must be popular. The menu wasn't hugely extensive and felt like it hadn't been updated in a good 5 years or so. This isn't necesarily a bad thing.

So, I went for the Eggs Benedict.\\n\\nBrunch, espeically after a hard night partying with some of the best Yelpers in town the night before, is sacred to me. It should soothe your hungry tummy, calm your slightly sore head, and warm the cockles of your soul. The eggs benedict were nice enough but quite bland. And they weren't served with bacon, they were served with wafer-thin slices of smoked ham. A bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nAlso, it didn't help that we were sitting near-ish the front door, and once or twice a waitress stood holding it open when talking to customers, lettings all the freezing cold air in, and cooling down my eggs a lot. The result was one tasty egg, and one very cold egg. Humpf.\\n\\nThe cakes in the cake stand looked very nice. And I've heard there is a great jazz night here, which I must investigate.\\n\\nBut compared to other places I've eaten brunch in, this was very average.

I had a hard time finding a room for 5. This Westin was the only one that had a suite with two double beds and a sleeper sofa for 5 guests. The room was spacious and nicely appointed, but came with a high price tag. Although they charged for the 5th person, there were only 4 sets of bedding and towels. The sleeper sofa had crumbs of chips and other junk food under bottom cushions. The room was never made the next morning. When we requested extra bedding and the room be cleaned, nobody came for 30 minutes. Concierge hesitated to recommend restaurants frequented by locals and not by tourists and insisted on going to canned places on the map. The highlight of our stay was the swimming pool. The bottom of the pool can be seen from the hotel entrance on the atrium ceiling as if it was a fish tank. There were 3 pools - a heated one for swimming, a large hot tub and a tub with cold water. That made our kid's weekend. Gym looked very nice, though we never used it. We stayed at many nice suites at other locations within similar price range and always had a wonderful time.

I recently left Charter once UVerse came into our area since it has the best to offer as far as DVR, channels provided for price (including promotions such as HBO, Showtime, Big Ten Network, NFL, MLB networks, etc), and the $150 gift card for signing up. Charter is better for high def TV (AT&T you pay extra), faster Internet, and unlimited phone and fax line is free if needed. Although faster Internet that Charter advertises may be overkill, as Consumer Reports recently noted that 15mbps is the most that the average consumer needs, and I get 18mbps with UVerse, which is slower than Charter. \\n\\nAT&T UVerse has the worst customer service by far. Recently I have had about a month of contacting the company (via telephone and on-line chat) for problems with transferring my phone number from Charter to UVerse. Something as simple as this still has not happened. The telephone customer service agents cannot give me anything in writing (no email, letter, anything), and cannot contact Charter directly, or if they do, they ask that I call Charter (already have 3 times). AT&T Uverse customer service agents have horrible documentation of the previous communications with their customers. They also call and leave messages that are so mumbled I cannot understand them. They also promise to call back at certain times then never call back. \\n\\nI was also promised my first bill would be $128 + tax, and the first time activation fee of $49 would be waived.

{"label":2,"text":"Before I begin my review, it's important to note that I arrived without a reservation on the night of their one-year anniversary (total accident).  I was greeted in a very unusual way; I was told they could seat me at the bar if I left at exactly 6 o'clock (I walked in right when they opened at 5).  I worked in the service industry for over 2 years and I have never told a guest that they can eat if they leave in an hour.  It's sort of a ridiculous request; as a customer, you can't control how long it takes for your food to come up.  It's also not very welcoming; then again it was their anniversary, I had no reservation and they were squeezing me in.  I think the better way to have handled it would have been to put no deadline on my dinner and quietly tell the kitchen to rush any order I put in. Regardless, I was seated and my server was very sweet and I felt right at home. I ordered the piece of cheese, fruit, and grilled nut bread for an appetizer. I was brought an excellent slice of brie, perfect plums and a spicy fruit spread.  The bread was burned though. Not necessarily worth $9, but still okay. For my salad course I ordered the bloomsdale spinach, sungold tomatoes, pinenuts and goat ricotta. Oh my God!  Amazing. The bloomsdale spinach is this leafy green, similar in appearance and texture to kale without the nasty taste. Because it wasn't limp, the dressing didn't wilt the leaves and the contrast in texture with the pinenuts and ricotta goat cheese was superb. I was really impressed they didn't go with the usual feta. It was susggested I order the pasta, chanterelles (type of mushroom), bacon, tarragon, asiago, butternut squash and creme fraiche dish. I ordered it without bacon and it arrived with bacon.  No big deal, except no one checked on whether I was enjoying the dish; I had to flag someone down, which was a challenge and took 10 minutes.  Normally this would not have been a big deal, but I was on a deadline and only had 20 minutes left. When the new dish of pasta arrived it was so overwhelmed with asiago, I couldn't discern between the mushrooms and squash--all I tasted was cheese and creme fraiche. Also, at $21 for a modest portion, it was slightly overpriced (although I realize the ingredients are seasonal and exceptional quality).  If you do decide to order that dish, I recommend asking for no cheese; the creme fraiche was enough. My server asked if I would like dessert and I said I couldn't--it was 6. He told me he could move me to another table and I could have my dessert there.  It seemed like a lot of hassle and I just wanted to take my leftovers home and enjoy them without rushing, so I declined.  He brought me my check and a yummy minature cookie and I was on my way. Overall, I think the menu is thoughtful but overpriced.  If you are a foodie, I strongly recommend going for the experience but making a reservation first. Bon Appetit!"}

NEVER.\\n\\nAlso, there is no indoor seating -- there is only an outdoor seating area (no shade) by the street.\\n\\nBecause it's in Vegas, and because The Strip is lacking cheap Mexican food, I will probably come back, but if this place were in LA I would probably skip it."}

Well, I figure I did ballet for a while, took a Duncan and later a Dunham workshop, made my way through all right and since no level was mentioned it shouldn't be too hard, right?\\nWell, I was only mildly embarrassed.  This particular class was at a solid intermediate modern dancer level and MAN did I sweat - it was the Horton technique, if you're familiar, very influenced by indigenous dance.  I was a little resentful at times but in hindsight I appreciate the teacher for moving along at the level of the class, keeping it challenging but not calling undue attention to my (or a couple of other relative n00b looking dancers) errors.  At the end of the class she said something like \\\"beginners - don't be scared!  Come back and work work work! it!\\\"\\nWell, I was going to content myself with maybe trying another studio but I was lucky enough to find a different form of the schedule in the lobby - one that clearly marked that class as intermediate.

{"label":3,"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to check in out while in Vegas. First, it's right next to Encore in a small shopping plaza and it can be easy to miss if you're not looking carefully. We got here at a descent hour and we had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The place was a nice spot with these low sitting couches and chairs and there was loud club music blaring. The hookahs were huge about 4 feet tall, so careful not to knock it over. Overall it was kind of a strange experience, the hookah was pretty good and the guys were okay about refilling and replacing the coals, but I felt they were more attentive to tables that were shedding out more money with more people. But hey that's vegas right. It was kind of hard to talk to our friends in this place because the music was so loud! So just know that if you're coming here to chill and have some hookah you might not be able to talk to them."}

{"label":1,"text":"Dinner there this past weekend. Ive waited three days to write a review to allow some distance from the evening and see if I feel better about it. I don't. \\nOur reservation for four were for 7:pm. We arrived promptly and were all very excited, we had been planning this dinner for a while. We requested a table on the porch and were seated and addressed by the waiter quickly. The table ordered a full bodied bottle of Pinot Noir wine on the recommendation of the waiter, when it arrived it was the label he recommended but (even by his own admission) the wine didn't have a taste profile that met the expectation he set. It was good but a thin light Pinot with little body and not what we anticipated. We kept the bottle to be cordial and it was enjoyed in spite of the mistake. Not a big deal... \\nWe ordered our appetizers at about 7:30. We received them at about 8:20 (they had one large table but were not full by any means) this could have been forgivable had the appetizers not arrived staggered leaving two plates undelivered and two sitting on the table. When they all finally arrived the food was great. \\nWhile waiting for the main course I went to the restroom. The mens room was filthy. The back of the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days. Ive seen dive bars with cleaner facilities. The wall has black scuff marks obviously from people using a foot to flush the toilet. The tiny trash can was overflowing and the floor had water (I hope) all over it. I couldn't believe it possible for a restaurant of this caliber to allow their facilities to be so poorly kept.\\nI returned to the table and we began the wait for our dinners. They arrived another 45 minutes after the appetizers (it was past 9pm). Our Dinner portions were meager and all of the entrees lacked vegetables or greenery of any kind. It was clear the focus was on form over food. The plating was beautiful but the meal itself was so so.  By the time we finished eating and were ordering dessert it was almost 10pm. We were given an apology by the waiter (who aside from the wine mistake, was fantastic). The manager also stopped by for a moment to apologize however the four chocolate truffles he sent to the table as an apology for dinner turning into a three + hour event were hardly a compensation for the wait, the wine issue, the mediocre dinner, or the condition of the facilities. For the price we paid (in time as well as money) the value simply isnt there in my opinion. Perhaps they just had an off night... I know we certainly wont take the risk again to find out, there are too many great places to eat in downtown."}

I used to live blocks away from this place, and the location was ideal, for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn, now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and\/or confrontations here, but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast, not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies, ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers, go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!"}

Located in the Promenade on Providence shopping center, the store had cards, gifts, wrapping paper, knick knacks, etc.  I found the perfect Shoebox card to send to my folks and then wandered to the attached Ann's Boutique store, which had jewelry, scarves, bags and gifts for women.  I found a lovely multi-colored bubble necklace that I cannot wait to wear.\\n\\nThe employees from both sides were very friendly and the store was clean.

{"label":2,"text":"I want to give this place more stars, but I can't...\\n\\nAfter 6 years we finally made it to Havana Cafe due to our recent Groupon purchase...YAY! We always wanted to try it out but the prices always scared us away. \\n\\nWhen we arrived on a Saturday night we were surprised that the place wasn't extremely busy. I told the hostess \\\"2 please\\\" and she said do you have reservations? \\\"Umm no, do we need them\\\" (as I looked around the half empty place)?!\\n\\nShe said my wait would be about 20 mins, fine, it's Saturday night. We sat at the bar for about 15 mins before the bartender even looked at us. She finally said are you eating dinner at the bar? \\\"No.\\\" That was it. \\n\\nWe finally were seated but it was at the back of the place. My husband and I ordered our drinks. Our server asks as loud as she possibly can for our IDs...ok sure no problem, but did you have to announce it to the half empty room that you are checking our age?! For the record, we are way over 21! \\n\\nOur food took FOREVER to arrive. We said the wait better be worth it and you know what...IT WAS! We ordered the Maduros Fritos,  Bistecs Cubanos with smothered onions and Masas de Puerco Fritas both with beans and rice. The meat was tender, the rice was moist and the fried plantains were sweet!  We did try desert, bread pudding and would not order that again. \\n\\nWe'll probably go back at some point, but we will definitely make reservations and we'll be hitting up lunch for the lower prices!  :)"}

One of the managers there, Glenn saw me wondering around and offered to assist me.  I must say, he certainly knows how to provide great service.  He asked me a few questions and before I knew it he had picked out the perfect gifts for me.  I certainly wasn't expecting such great service at such a touristy place, but Glenn proved me wrong.

{"label":0,"text":"Why didn't I check the reviews first? Instead, I just picked the first shuttle company that was there. Incompetent AND rude, to boot!\\n\\nThe ride from the airport to the convention hotel was fine, even a pleasant driver.\\n\\nThe ride back to the airport, scheduled for 4:00. I call to check the status at 4:00, just as a check to make sure everything's normal, since delays happen, etc. \\\"It'll be there in five minutes.\\\" At 4:10, I call again. \\\"It'll be there in less than five minutes. It's \\\"just down the street,\\\" At 4:20, guess what I hear again? She contacted them and it'll be there in five minutes, it's just down the street. At 4:30, they finally say that the shuttle actually already left for the airport and they'll send another. Which arrives finally at 4:45.\\n\\nDid I mention that they say to wait outside and it's 107 degrees out? 45 minutes in the heat isn't exactly fun. If they'd said from the start that it would be a 45 minute wait I could have gone inside and waited. \\n\\nThe dispatcher didn't actually apologize for the delay until I prompted her during the 4:20 call.\\n\\nSo either the dispatcher was talking out of something other than her mouth when she said that she had talked to the driver and he was just down the street, or they never actually scheduled the pick up and were going to get me only if there was room and there wasn't. Or, to be paranoid, she gets some fun from telling drivers to skip pickups. Judging from her attitude, the last option isn't exactly that unlikely. \\n\\nWouldn't use them again unless the alternative were walking."}

{"label":1,"text":"I used to think this place was ok. But the prices keep on going up. I've been IDed on too many occasions sometimes by the same people. This wouldn't happen in any other shop that I went into on a regular basis to buy alcohol in. Plus some of them waste your time even more by getting out a book and writing down the details of the sale even though it wasn't refused, do that in your time not mine. \\n\\nAlso recently complained about something recently - minor issue the plastic milk bottles weren't actually up to the line, they weren't full ie you were getting less milk than you were paying for. Rather than anyone in the store sorting this out and offering a little off the price had to ring their office who brushed us off.\\n\\nAnd Nectar, for the information they get about what different people purchase they should be paying us much more, what is it 1p for every \\u00a35 spent?"}
{"label":3,"text":"This was our second time at this restaurant and both occasions have been very good. We didn't have reservations, but were promptly seated.

{"label":0,"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite with friends before a conference.  The drinks came right away.  After waiting over 45 minutes for our food, we finally received one order:  allegedly \\\"chili nachos,\\\" it was a plate of dry tortilla chips accompanied by a cup of cold chili and a cup of ice-cold, congealed nacho cheese.  When we asked where our other four orders were, the server was very defensive - \\\"sorry about the wait, but a bunch of other people just left and cancelled their orders, so we had to deal with that.\\\"  (Wow, can't imagine why that happened!)  At that point, we decided that we needed to leave without the food, because our conference sessions were about to begin.  To his credit, the bartender said he wouldn't charge us for the drinks.  We tipped him and left.  I've had decent - if not stellar - experiences at the location in Tucson, but I'm certainly never visiting this location again (and I'll probably think twice before patronizing the Tucson location, too.  There are too many places with good food and service to waste time on a place like this.)\\n\\nI almost forgot to mention that the booth was comically decrepit - giant holes in the seat and a spring poking out from under the seat, occasionally scraping my leg if I wasn't careful.  And...for the coup de grace, when we exited the booth, the seat completely collapsed.  It was actually sort of hilarious."}
{"label":2,"text":"This would be a 3.5 star place - \\n\\nLove the old vegas look, cheap prices, glittery light show, and more local feel.  99 cent frozen chocolate covered bananas are the bomb!  Hennessey's is a great value with really good food.  2 dollar blackjack!  Fresh donuts from Krispy Kreme!  Free shows (good and bad).\\n\\nNot in love with the rude people (but they're everywhere).  The casinos have low ceilings, which means lots of cigarette smoke lingering.  Wouldn't walk far from the light show, but plenty of security on the strip itself.\\n\\nIn general, it's a good contrast to the mega-corporate new strip, doesn't have the awesome food, but doesn't have the awe-inspiring prices either.  A lot of fun for the right reasons.  Just a matter of what you're in the mood for.\\n\\nJust remember:  Vegas is about fun - and the Fremont Street Experience packs a lot of it into a 3.5 short blocks."}
{"label":1,"text":"Seems like my review will be the contentious one. I'll put my hand up now and admit, I hadn't realised that the fried food was in animal fat until Jenny L came to my rescue, so my original order was consigned to the bin and I was left with grilled haddock with a tomato pesto crust and a replacement side salad. It was laughable. Replace crust with tomato pesto slapped on top of fish and that is more like it. Admittedly, the haddock was cooked very well, otherwise this would be a one star review. \\n\\nThe boy was equally disappointed in his meal (greasy) and the service (overenthusiastic waitresses trying to take his plate away while he was still eating, making it clear that it was time for us to leave). Some orders seemed to be confused although overall, it wasn't too big a concern, but rather confusing when the bill arrived. There seemed to be a disproportionate number of bowls of chips (sharing, rather than individual portions) across our large party as well, leaving our side begging others for more. \\n\\nThe side salad that I was given in replacement of chips was (drum roll): 2 slices of tomato, a pinch of salad leaves and some sliced onion. This is a salad that rabbits would turn Watership Down over, and I don't mean the good rabbits. All of this cost me 12 quid, as my original order wasn't taken off the bill. That's one expensive fillet of haddock with salad garnish. Will I come back? Frankly, no. There are equal and better fish and chip restaurants where you get a fresh order and don't pay double the price, nor exclude the minority in doing so. I guess it's a reminder that when you talk about gourmet fish and chips, it really is in the eye of the beholder to make that judgement. I left almost as hungry as I came, and won't repeat the experience again."}

Unlike some stores, the walls and shelves were not crammed floor to ceiling.  Instead, the displays were laid out in an uncluttered manner that doesn't bombard your brain with a lot of information.  \\n\\nThe store is quite large, and covers all aspects of photography.  You can get all sorts of cameras from small point-and-shoot right up to high-end digital SLRs.  They also stock binoculars and telescopes, along with accessories for all of these things.  I had a good look at their range of tripods, which covered a large price and size range.\\n\\nJessops is a must for either browsing or buying photographic equipment.

I'm not sure what bar they were talking about, but it isn't Casey Moore's.  This is the type of place people go to be seen.

{"label":4,"text":"I've been there twice - once at night, and another time at sunset for a breathtaking panoramic view of Las Vegas both in the day and at night. Of course, Vegas is always prettier at night. Still, watching the sunset is always a beautiful experience....\\n\\nAs for the rides - I've always been a fan of thrill rides... now pair that with hanging off the edge of a building as you see the city below you or being shot 160 feet in the air at 45 miles per hour as you overlook the city.\\n\\nI personally think it's well worth the $30."}
{"label":2,"text":"This review is based solely on Sandbar as a nightlife spot, I didn't eat there, just drank, heavily, and danced, heavily, and based on my few moments of clarity between shots these are my thoughts....\\n\\nSandbar offers some great music and a dance floor to get your groove on.  It's only been open a week so it was packed! If you don't get there before 10 pm expect to wait in a long line and not find a table to park your drinks at.  The ambience is very cool and it is pretty big, there actually are a lot of tables both inside and out. There are 4 cabanas on the outside patio that you can reserve if you have a large group and promise to spend at least $300, which is very easy to do with a large group. The sand and small pool are a nice touch, I did get a little sand in my shoes but didn't mind one bit. The dance floor isn't huge but it doesn't get too packed we always found a spot to comfortably shake our groove things, the DJ plays hip hop, some rock and even a little country while they show the videos on the flat screens, they even played SNL's digital short On a Boat with Andy Samberg & T-Pain which is very danceable and very hilarious.  \\n\\nNow we did have a few issues but I think it's based on the fact that this place is new and so so packed and management did try to make amends so I'm not going to knock them too much for it. It was my sister's birthday so we called in advance to reserve a cabana for the night but then they called us back a day later and said they had actually overbooked so we no longer had the cabana, we then made reservations for dinner but once we got there they did not have a spot for us to sit, they had anticipated another big party would leave before we got there and they did not, so we had to go somewhere else for food, but the manager offered my sister free drinks when we came back later and they did reserve us some high tops by the dance floor when we came back so that was nice. We never had to wait too long for our waitress to come back around and offer more drinks either, another plus.\\n\\nAlso because it is so packed there is more of a possibility of having a few knucklheads in the crowd, we actually saw a fight early in the night, small and squashed quickly. Then later in the evening some drunky tried to fight a guy in our group, I think this drunky had little man complex and he was in the crowd and he bumped into our friend at the same time that someone else bumped into him so he thought our friend purposely bumped him. Our friend was actually the designated driver so he was completely sober and the drunk 5 foot tall guy tried to fight the sober 6 foot tall guy who kept telling him to walk away, which he did, only to come back later with his 5 1\/2 foot tall friend to avenge him. It was all stupid and the management could see that it was just two drunk guys trying to prove they weren't scared of the big guy and they kicked the knuckleheads out and let us stay.  The night was saved and we actually stayed until the last song at 2 a.m. chit chatting and dancing the night away.\\n\\nI will definitely go back, maybe not for a few weeks when it isn't so crowded but with it being one of the few dance spots in Chandler this probably won't happen any time soon, which is good for them. We went on a Saturday but I've heard Friday is just as packed."}
{"label":2,"text":"Last time I stayed here was three years ago - stayed for three nights. This time was for one overnight only.\\n\\nThe AC in my room was not working well. It was enough to cool off the room - but it still felt a tad on the humid side. Again, another really old hotel with an inefficient, antiquated central AC system. Given the nature of this building, I doubt they could ever retrofit the building with the necessary HVAC infrastructure to improve it. I could be wrong.\\n\\nOne plus over the last time I stayed here is that the old analog style, CRT-based TVs are now gone - at the least in the room I stayed in had a newer flat panel HD TV set.\\n\\nAs before in my previous review:\\n\\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late.  We attempted to visit both the above 7-11 and CVS - but it was after 10:00 pm and three years later they ar still keeping the same limited hours.\\n\\nAnd you can't get any food at the Braddock Bar in the Hotel lobby after 10:00 pm or so. Very annoying."}
{"label":0,"text":"Where do I start... Oh yeah. The people watching at this place is wonderful. The abundance of tweekers and crackheads is amazing. With that aside, it's a Mcdonalds! That's all I have to say about the food. The service was not good at all , the staff seemed overwhelmed with a small lunch rush. My order was missing a hamburger ( the main part of one of the meals I ordered), an apple juice (part of a kids meal) and cup for one of the drinks. They did fix it quickly. Oh there was an employee in the dinning area making the floor super sticky ( I think she was mopping with a mop bucket that had cleaned up a spilled soda, just a guess) so that was nice. So I would definitely would not recommend you try this particular McDonald's.  In and out it's just across the street."}
{"label":3,"text":"This place is truly a \\\"compound,\\\" with multiple buildings of hotel room suites, 6 pools, a few restaurants, and an entire waterpark.  It takes a lot of walking to get around, but if you can find your way back to the main lobby, they will shuttle or golf cart you wherever you'd like to go.  The staff is friendly  and they have big baskets of lollipops in the lobby, which was cute.\\n\\nMy suite was bigger than some apartments I've lived in for years.  It was clean, quiet, and nicely appointed.  It did smell of smoke, but didn't keep me from sleeping soundly or enjoying my time there.  My work pals tell me that local families stay here sometimes just to use the waterpark.  Sounds like fun to me!"}
{"label":2,"text":"I used to go here often but with better choices available, I haven't been there recently.  We went here this evening.  The food is OK.  There are no real standouts.  Like other buffets, the variety of food has been cut back.  This was very noticeable at the salad bar.  Much of it was ice with many fewer bowls spread over the area.\\n\\nI was going to get some jambalaya as I had in the past, but it looked liked there were cubes of processed ham instead of the sausage they used to have.  I skipped this dish.  I did get some salt and pepper fried oysters.  They were very tasty, but the breading was quite think and soft--a problem with some buffet food items.\\n\\nThey did have some nice vegetables--cauliflower in a cheese sauce (a little watery) and brussel sprouts with pieces of cooked bacon.  \\n\\nA summary would be that the buffet is OK.  The food is very standard cafeteria type with nothing really outstanding.  I think the lunch buffet is a better value."}

It was so polite!!\\nThe food was also great.  Between the four of us, not one of us had a complaint.  I would for sure go again and I would tell others to go as well.  \\nOh and the atmosphere is super fun too :)"}

It's a little joint that you get in line to order, walk around the corner to pick up, and pay after you eat.  \\nI ordered the 3 tacos so I could sample their selections.  I got one fish, one carnitas, and one carne asada.  The fish was good, the carnitas was better, and the carne asada was just ok.  \\nYou can pick the toppings, the sides, the meat and the tortilla. They have a soda fountain, bottle and canned drinks.... and I even some some beer selections. \\nThis is very casual quick grab some lunch kind of place, but the food was good and the staff friendly.

{"label":2,"text":"This is a neither a yay or nay place for me.  Understanding the underlying concept of the sandwiches from way back when, can make a person appreciate Primanti's for what they are.\\n\\nI ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.  \\n\\nI think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.\\n\\nThe place itself is small and good for a group of four.

{"label":4,"text":"OK, this place is not for your average pet owner...\\n\\nThe prices here are higher than PetSmart or other kennels, but the accomodation and service are exceptional:  \\n\\n1)  Even the base rooms are quite large.

There is even a Presidental Suite that is bigger and more luxorious than a lot of studio apartments.  \\n\\n2)  The animals are only locked up at night... all day they get to run around in one of two large areas inside and play with the other dogs.  They also have a grassy area indoors to allow the dogs to do their duty.  :)\\n\\n3)  The staff is very friendly and loves animals.  My dog lost about 7 lbs during a 2-week stay here due to all of the running around with the other dogs... they actually called me told me he looked skinny asking if they could up the amount of food he was getting.\\n\\n4)  Location is very convienant to the airport--easy to drop off and pick up.\\n\\n5)  Everything is indoors, so there is no need to worry about your dog running off while being walked on the leash.  Also, during the summer months, it is comforting to know that my dog is not outside dying in the heat.\\n\\nThey also offer Doggy Day Care which has proven useful a few times."}

Its by no means healthy, but its a lot better than any fast food you could put in your body.  The tartar sauce is famous and for good reason...its the best I've ever had and cannot be replicated (the recipe is super secret).

{"label":3,"text":"Another fantastic greenway in Mecklenburg county. This one is located in the heart of Matthews. It has entrances at E. Johns St & S. Trade St along with plenty of access from the surrounding neighborhoods. There is ample parking at Squirrel Lake too, which is located off Pleasant Plains Rd. There are more that 2 miles of paved trails that meander through the woods. Meck Park & Rec did a great job with the design. Nice wide trails, accurate mile markers, miniature street signs that let you know what streets feed into the trail from the surrounding neighborhoods, conveniently located trash cans w\/ \\\"doggy bags\\\" for your four legged friends  & even a few pieces of art in one area. The Squirrel Lake section has a huge playground & picnic areas along with a 12 hole disc golf course. I'm out here at least once or twice a week for a good run. The E. John St entrance is just off the Matthews I-485 exit (this is where I start). To run it from one end to the other and hit a few side paths, I can easily get in a 5 mile run.

Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\\n\\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\\n\\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston. Luckily, I can get re-aligned over the coming months! Pittsburgh pricing is rad. This place is rad. No smoking is rad. And the low-key winter is rad when compared to how much of a crush eating here can be in nice weather."}

Not much you expect from oatmeal... But the problem is that they gave me super sour\/tart with awful tasting blueberries that weren't ripe. I had to remove them from the oatmeal. I told the waitress about them and didn't really get a sincere response. Next thing I see is another guy taking the box of blueberries somewhere else from the kitchen...I hope I don't get sick from it. Then I had the oscar omelet which was so so. Food is not as upscale as the place looks. I told my friend, don't take me here for my bday ever lol!"}

It appears that the person who gave the quote over the phone did not explain how they count windows, did not communicate to the tech what the quote was - or if he did, the tech did not clarify the difference in pricing until after he finished the work.\\nBecause of the amount they wanted to charge, and we finally paid, was significantly different than was quoted or clarified before work was completed - I would not recommend them unless they clean up their pricing practices."}

{"label":0,"text":"This course has an ok layout and a couple holes with nice views, however it doesn't make up for a rude staff that pushed us every other hole to keep a faster pace. They talked down to us and were being rude. Not even one \\\"hello, are you having a good time?\\\"  No courtesy at all, just rudeness. On a Sunday early morning we maintained a 4 1\/2 hr pace while having to search for our balls in monsoon casual water collection areas and high rough. We let a 3 some play through and were not pushed much from behind, yet the staff kept harrassing us and threatening to make us skip a hole. What?? I have never had this experience at another course even if there was slow play that day.  Here, it wasn't even crowded yet they kept annoying us. What an unenjoyable day and waste of gas money to drive all the way out there.  Never again.  The 1 star is just for 3 nice holes on the mountainside, otherwise i'd try giving negative stars."}

{"label":0,"text":"I had a TERRIBLE experience here. I had a mani-pedi done with a friend and everything seemed to be going fine. Once our mani-pedis were complete, the woman who did our nails asked for a tip. We both gave her a 15% tip but she said that was not enough, as we needed to tip her and the man who  massaged our hands. Fair enough. My nails were under a dryer and my purse was on the bench next to me. The woman literally REACHED INTO MY PURSE and pulled out my wallet. I asked her what in the world she was doing and she said she was just being considerate of my drying nails. I took the wallet back and opened it to get a tip out for the man. She then LOOKED INSIDE MY WALLET and pointed to the $20 bill. I said \\\"No, I am using a Groupon today and that would be about a 70% tip if I gave you that.\\\" I gave her a $5 bill to give to the man and she kept badgering me and my friend saying \\\"I want the $20. The $20 will be a good tip.\\\" I gave her the $5 and she refused to take it saying it would not be enough. She continued this for 5 more minutes. I then asked for the manager because this woman was clearly ruining the fun day my friend and I just had. The manager gave us $10 vouchers for the \\\"next time\\\" we came to Lo Ann, but we both agreed these coupons were pointless since we would NEVER come back. A truly awful experience.

{"label":1,"text":"I would give this place a 4 star rating for value and flavor. Everything else from\\nCleanliness, location, outside surroundings ambience etc almost wants me to knock it down to a 1.\\nOriginally we were headed to Lotus of Siam but they were closed. We tried the neighboring Korean restaurant and it was closed too. This rundown strip mall is riddled with Korean restaurants and this one happened to be the only one open on a Sunday afternoon. I honestly would never come to this type of strip mall under any circumstances but the lure of yelps promise was hard to resist. The parking lot was barren! Tumble weeds and a gang of pigeons hiding underneath a broke down van. I had to open up my yelp app just to make sure those 4 stars came from recent reviews. We walked in and it was like walking into one of those salons in a ghost town. Outdated, barren, empty, tables that have not been bussed and posters of food as the only decor. The two ladies that waited on us was very friendly and accommodating and is one of the biggest reasons I would like to give them more stars. We looked over the menu, the usuals I wanted was not there and there was no dish I could get for $10 which I thought would be pretty high for the way the establishment looked. I wanted to walk out but we were the only ones there and the girl was really nice. We ended up ordering an assortment of meats that we grill ourselves, good for two, comes with rice, drinks and the usual array of pickled sides $35.95. The grill and vent was clean. When she brought the plate of meat I was truly disturbed with the raw chicken and it's juices on the same plate as the thinly sliced steak. So if you go ask for your chicken on a separate plate. She helped us grill it and the flavors were different not as sweet as the other Korean restaurants I patron but still it was good and different in an interesting way. We were stuffed and she was still bringing us meat this is the most meat I have ever gotten at any Korean restaurant. Everything I needed more of they brought over promptly, without extra charge and without and attitude. This is a big deal for me because in other Korean restaurants they usually don't follow up on you, they have reservations about giving you extra of their sides and one I actually got into an argument for a to go box. These ladies checked on us frequently and brought us everything we needed another reason I wish I could give them a better score. In the end our total was $38.95 which  I think was pretty damn good for all that food. I was certain despite all the negatives I would rate this place 3 stars but midway through this review we both experienced an onslaught of mild stomach agitation and when my boyfriend came out of the restroom his first words were drop it to two stars so yea."}

I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.

{"label":0,"text":"First off I would like to say that our experience was like night and day compared to the last time we were here. It's funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has.\\nLet me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother's Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, \\\"This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here\\\". Well I'm not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here.\\nWe ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit. \\nI do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I've been a GM for some time, and I don't believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses'. Rustler's Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.\\n\\nTom,\\nFirst off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler's Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience. \\nI pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate. \\nThe overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time. \\nI appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler's Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn. \\nThanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don't think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler's Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee's in the late '80s. It used to be some place special to take out of town visitors, kind of a land mark if you will. I just think that time and expectations have changed."}

It was a very laid back meal and experience.\\n\\nWe started out with the salumi and  a bleu cheese plate, both very good. The salumi was served with sweet mustard and crusty bread. The bleu cheese was served this jelly, It tasted kind of like raspberry. Both were verry good, and I think 5 or 6 bucks a piece. For my meal, I opted for two appetizers: Potato fritters with creme fraiche and truffles and the mussels with pork shoulder and pommes frites. Both dishes were awesome. Somehow, they managed to make the potato fritters super light and airy, out of this world. The mussel dish was great too, humongous portion of well cooked mussels in a killer broth. Add in a few Stella's and my total bill was around $50 with tax and tip. A little higher than I'd like for a quick stop in meal, but definitely well worth it.

You have to keep calling to see if they have been received because they can't call you to let you know and here I am a month later still they say they never received them so I request for them to fax the paperwork. Fax number on the website (the main website) should be right don't you think? I call back and tell Arial that a fax should be coming she asked where I sent it and I gave her the fax from their website and she argued with me. All I was stating is that the website is wrong and she says \\\"I don't care what the website says it is not our fax number\\\" really??? She could have handled that completely different. If you don't want to deal with people or give them compassion you shouldn't be in health care. If it wasn't so hard to find a good doctor in this town I would not be using this office. Doctors are great customer service is horrible."}

Funny part is when you're at the front of the line, about to enter - they actually have a photographer there who will take your picture (like you're at Disneyland) if you want.  \\n\\nThere was nothing wrong with the buffet, but it was rather enlightening\/disappointing when we had lunch at the Aria buffet the next day and they essentially had all the same things (and I'm talking about the good stuff - shrimp, cold and warm crab legs - in fact, their crab legs tasted even better than Baccahanal's).

{"label":1,"text":"I am going to start off by just stating that this place is hit-or-miss.  I've been here before for events and had a great time.  Everyone loves the cocktails and the bartender KNOWS his tequilas.  I've never really sat down for serious eating here until two days ago.  I waited 48 hours to write this and I still can't shake feeling ripped off.  \\n\\nI generally shrug off service issues.  La Comida is a hip place in a currently hip part of town.  I'm not there for Zagat rated service.  But in a restaurant a quarter full, we shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a server. This set the stage. We asked about any specials, but the server told us they are listed on the menu. I then pointed out those were SPECIALTIES, do they have any daily specials? I then told him in Spanish. He got it, laughed and said no.  Pretty matter of fact, but on top of a ten minute wait, not appreciated.\\n \\nI ordered the shrimp ceviche. My date the chicken burrito.  My \\\"dinner\\\" came back a little cup of miniature shrimp, no bigger than a dime, on top of some diced fruits and avocado. It looked and tasted like half of the serving you get in a 99 cent shrimp cocktail in sundae glass up the block the California Hotel on Fremont Street.  Worse? It tasted like it! I couldn't believe it. The way it was described by the waiter, it seemed it would at least be in league with similar restaurants.  This couldn't even hold a candle to Applebee's.  This dish was $12 and it couldn't have cost them more than a quarter to make.  I was livid, but on a date, so just smiled....and drank my warm Modelo.\\n\\nMy date fared better. The chicken burrito had a chewy tortilla wrap, but the chicken was good and somewhat ample.  It was also kind of pricy at 12 bucks, but could tolerate it because was more than a cup of miniature brine shrimp at the same price. My date's Modelo was also warm (but we were told they were supposed to be like that by the waiter. OLE')\\n\\nBottom line...this is a destination restaurant more for taking selfies with drinks in hand than actually eating food.  I don't think the owners, Jenna and Michael Morton, who are renowned for creating dining experiences, are probably even privy to this kind of spotty food and service going on.  I'm hoping they are not.  But if it's really good food you want for the money, I'd say have a drink here first and move on."}

I used Joey for my enagament photos around the strip (7\/3\/13) and for wedding (10\/17\/13). I decided I wanted a non traditional intimate wedding but wanted something special with family and close friends. When I decided on a Vegas wedding... I thought I probably wouldnt be able to get an amazing photographer.  I know in other area like the bay area (where Im from) and southern California (where I currently live) the average rate for wedding photographers is around $3000+ that would have been around 30% of my wedding budget! Having amazing photos of my wedding was one of the most important vendor decisions (above floral, makeup, even venue etc). I love photography and these photos are how I will forever remember my wedding. I was delighted to find Joeys website. He had an extensive portfolio and he even posted his AFFORDABLE rates on his website.  He answered all my emails promtly. My photos are gorgeous!  I get so many compliments on them. He almost made the ceremony look even more beautiful then it was... how does someone do that? My mother-in-law commented about the ceremony photos \\\"this is how Heaven must look like\\\"...which is funny because I thought the same thing. He really went above and beyond. During my engagment shoot, he met us on a holiday weekend on the strip at 9pm and worked with us until after midnight to get thousands of shots (he charged a low flat rate for this). It was 110\\u00b0 at night and the streets were packed! At my wedding he worked tirelessly throughout the 8 hours we hired him for... he wouldnt he even take a break when I asked him to have something to eat. My guests even remarked on how hard he was working.  Thank you Joey for giving us amazing wedding photos that we will treasure for the rest of our life!"}

{"label":2,"text":"Since buying a house in Bellevue, while it's being renovated, I've had many occasions to be in the area, with people to eat with. I'd heard nice things about this place, and thought I'd give it a try.\\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and we were the only people there. The decor is...well...adorable. Antique mirrors and chachki line the walls, lots of old wood, and at the moment, there was a ladder in the back of the room. We wondered if they were open, and a man appeared for a brief second, and then he was gone. I went to the counter, and a woman, the Thai owner, came out of the kitchen and said we could sit anywhere. We started to sit at a very cute little table in the window nook next to the door, and were warned that if people came in and out of the door, it could get cold, so we moved to the other side of the door window which was more recessed and sat at a tall table.\\n\\nWe looked over the menu, which seemed pretty staple, but the prices seemed a tad higher than they needed to be. The server was the hubby owner, a very all-American dad type, who greeted us with the little Thai prayer pose and bow, which frankly, looked kind of silly coming from an all-American dad type. He did it several times through the evening. If he were Asian, then it wouldn't seem so odd...\\n\\nWe both decided on the pad thai, and he took our order, and off to the kitchen he went. He'd left two glasses of water at the table, which was good because he didn't ask if we'd wanted anything else to drink.\\n\\nOne other couple came in while we waited, and sat at the 'cold' table. My friend and I had a nice long chat until the food came.\\n\\nThe plates arrived, and were the big fancy bistroid white plates, square and angled - with not a lot of food placed upon them. It looked more like a quick lunch portion that a dinner portion.\\n\\nThe pad thai was good. Nothing spectacular, but not bad at all. It is just a basic pad thai. They certainly could have thrown on another spoonful or two for the price tag. \\n\\nAfter the meal my friend asked for the ginger tea, and sipped it slowly, saying it kind of had a spice 'burn' to it.\\n\\nShe really enjoyed her meal, saying it was perfect, but she's a tiny little thing who doesn't eat much. But as a guy, I really didn't want to leave a meal to look for a meal.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is truly charming and comfortable, but a little 'cold'. It was kind of like sitting in the side room of an old library. Shhhhhhhhh! Pleasant, but it didn't have any kind of spark. The food is good, but there's not much of it, and you're paying kind of hefty bistroid prices for it, in an area that has no need for a bistroid, or the prices that go with it. \\n\\nAs I've stated multiple times in other reviews...I don't care what your 'atmosphere' levels are set at. I don't go out to eat 'atmosphere'...I go to eat FOOD. Never has an 'atmosphere' made me keep coming back. But a good portion of food at a fair price will every time.\\n\\nConsidering the other options in and around Bellevue, I can't say I would never return, but I would have to have a serious craving that couldn't be satisfied with a short drive elsewhere.  I really do think this place could be a bigger hit if they just weren't so skimpy on the portions. I wouldn't mind the price tag so much if I were actually sated.\\n\\nIf you're the uppity foodie type, this might be right up your alley. But if you like FOOD...well...enjoy...but pack a light lunch for the drive home."}

Be careful if you order these- they make them fresh for each order and they are HOT when they first come out!

{"label":3,"text":"WHEN I FIRST punched 'Hewat's Restaurant, Edinburgh' into Google my mouth watered at the number of rather appetising dishes the menu had to offer.  I thought to myself... 'This looks like my sort of food'.\\n\\nThe restaurant opened in Edinburgh in 2004 and is run by husband and wife team Richard and Margaret Hewat.  Chef Richard boasts a formidable CV indeed; positions as head chef at RBS world headquarters and Fisher's in Leith giving him notable pedigree. With Margaret's wealth of front of house experience, the couple work closely to maintain the reputation of this well-established business.\\n\\nThe warm, rich dining room had a lovely atmosphere to it indeed.  Each table immaculately laid and complemented by the glow from the tasteful chandeliers and contemporary art work which adorned the spotlessly clean dining room.\\n\\nFor starter I opted for Cullen skink with mussels (\\u00a36).  I do enjoy sampling the different variations of this classic dish from chefs around the land I must say. The mussels were plump and perfectly cooked, as I'd expect from a chef who once headed a team (at Fisher's) that won the coveted Egon Ronay award for Seafood Restaurant of The Year.\\n\\nIt did take me a few mouthfuls to get into the dish as I felt it lacked a good whack of seasoning, but it did grow on me as the flavours from the smoked fish met with the creaminess of the soup to start the meal off on the right foot.  It was also great to see a restaurant make its own bread; something I feel sadly lacks in eateries these days.  \\n\\nSarah had warm duck and shallot tarte tatin with plum, port and balsamic dressing (\\u00a36.50).  This was a great idea for a dish but although the duck was tender and pink, the pastry was a little under done and the shallots needed a bit more caramelisation.  The sauce was very pleasant and harmonised the dish.\\n\\nThe dining room started to fill up as we came to the main event but that, to the staff's credit, did not alter the quality of the service as my roast tenderloin of wild boar, braised pork belly, apple compote, crackling and pulled pork and black pudding mash with savoy cabbage and chorizo (\\u00a316) was served up.\\n\\nAt first glance, I thought there were a lot of elements to this dish, all of which I like, but wasn't sure if it perhaps had too much going on.  I dived into the boar first, which was well executed and seasoned and complemented by the rich gravy.  \\n\\nPork belly is one of my favourite cuts of meat and I like to see it done justice. The actual meat itself dissolved on my tongue but I would have like to have seen the skin crisped up rather than left flabby. \\n\\nI didn't feel the stick of crackling that was offered really gave anything to the dish bar an aesthetic aspect and it wasn't particularly great crackling, as some parts were just too hard to bite through.\\n\\nThat in mind, I must give a special mention to the pulled pork and black pudding mash with the savoy cabbage as they were just a total triumph and worked in perfect harmony with the apple.  The chorizo just added that little hint of spice that lifted the dish up a notch. If only the skin on the belly had been seared for a minute or two, this would have been a knockout plate of food.\\n\\nFor main, Sarah had roast rump of new season lamb with redcurrant and rosemary jus, champ potatoes, red cabbage and ratatouille (\\u00a317).  \\n\\nThe lamb came presented in a rustic-style and was perfectly cooked; pink and tender while the red cabbage offered a great flavour and maintained a slight bite.  Every vegetable component of the ratatouille was perfectly cooked and identifiable through a rich tomato sauce with the seasoning bang on the money. \\n\\nA minor criticism would be the sprinkling of spices that seemed to come on every plate; it's just a tad outdated.\\n\\nWe admired the wine Margaret had recommended as we pondered our dessert course. \\n\\nWild strawberry cr\\u00e8me brulee with shortbread (\\u00a35.95) caught my eye while Sarah went for the classic sticky toffee pudding (also \\u00a35.95). \\n\\nThe brulee passed the acid test when I cracked the crisp top with my spoon to reveal a subtle and rather pleasant flavour of sesaonal strawberry.  The shortbread was buttery and with suitable snap, while the berry compote cut through the creaminess without being too sharp.\\n\\nSarah's sticky toffee pudding was light with a silky, smooth butterscotch sauce as you'd expect.  The vanilla ice cream was lovely and added a cold contrast to the pudding.  Both were a great way to end the meal.  \\n\\nI suppose at the end of any meal you ask yourself 'would I go back?' and I certainly will be back.  The level of cooking demonstrated by Richard and the quality of service leave me looking forward to discovering more of delights that got me so excited when I first laid eyes upon the menu at Hewat's."}

{"label":1,"text":"I really don't get what the big deal is about with this place. I went after reading all the rave reviews by other Yelpers last evening before heading to Gammage to see Wicked. For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed. \\n\\nFirst of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar. \\n\\nI'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.  \\n\\nThe food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value. \\n\\nOur server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons\/employees who were hanging around. \\n\\nIf I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit.

{"label":2,"text":"Since the Costco on MLK closed (now reopened since renovation, but is now dead to me), this has become THE Costco. You know what I'm talking about-the gas station is out of control, parking lot is always full and inside....take a valium before embarking on what is sure to be a PTSD-inducing experience. This is no fault of the staff here though which is for the most part friendly and helpful. Before I begin, take note that Costco takes Amex, Visa and cash. Do not argue with your cashier about this (I've seen people do it before). Costco will take what they take and right now it's Visa and Amex. \\n\\nThe problem with this Costco is the Costco Shopper. Don't act like you don't know who I'm talking about. You might be one of them. There's the sample buzzard who stops what they're doing, leaves their cart in the middle of the aisle and sprints towards a freshly cooked tray of potstickers as if it's the first thing they've eaten weeks. There's also the casual shopper who meanders through Costco like they have nowhere to be in the next 15 hours and doesn't care if anyone else does either. So they wheel their cart up the middle of each aisle and you have the misfortune of running into every third aisle.\\n\\nI digress. There are so many types and facets to the Costco shopper that can make a trip for a cookbook or wheel of cheese the size of a tire, a trip that will send you straight to the bar post-shopping. Not to worry, Costco carries wine and liquor, so should you need to restore sanity immediately you have a fine selection of industrial sized, name brand liquors at a good price to choose from. \\n\\nCostco is great for cheap gas, a wide variety of bulk items that are great for large families or singletons like myself who like to save a buck and several trips to the market for things like toilet paper. I like the gas station at Costco because there is a clear order for traffic flow and none of the nonsense line cutting that I've often experienced at regular gas stations. That being said, the lines are LONG. My suggestion is to go on a week day evening right before closing or even on a weekend evening right before closing. Saturday midday? Forget it. You'll be in line for no less than 15 minutes and still be hating life once you get to the pump because let's face it, gas is outrageous. \\n\\nWhen you go to this Costco, go in the mind set that the lines will be long, the customers will be in various stages of food coma however the prices will be right!"}

{"label":0,"text":"***It's a really long review, I hope it doesn't deter you from reading it***\\n\\n\\nI really wish yelp gave the option of  giving 1\/2 stars. . .  \\n\\nAnd so with that opening sentence, here is my review:\\n\\nA group of friends and I went to Dal Toro out of sheer desperation. It was a Saturday night and well, being Vegas, all the good restaurants were already booked. Now, I know that we could have gone to any restaurant but we were starving and that was the only place we could get. The restaurant is at The Palazzo and located in the lowest level of the hotel. It was actually really hard to find and feared that because we were late, our reservation had been canceled. No such thing. Upon finally arriving, we checked in with the hostess. While we waited to be seated, a bride and groom (it is Vegas after all) went up to the hostess and asked if they could accommodate a party of 23. They said they were willing to wait since it was a walk-in. The manager comes out and says that it will take about 15 minutes. Now, THAT should have been my first clue. Sadly, I thought nothing of it.\\n\\nThe hostess tells us that our table is ready, so we go in. Looking around, I didn't see that many people but again, didn't think twice about it. \\n\\nOur waiter comes to greet us and take our drink order. A few of us decide to get a bottle of wine while another one asked for a virgin daiquiri. The waiter tells her that they don't make frozen drinks there. So, she gets a Shirley Temple. Now, the wine selection was not that impressive and to be quite honest, they prices were a bit high.  \\n\\nWe get our drinks and now it's time to order.  2 get the Tuna Tartare, another on gets the Salad di Campo (which is just greens with yellow red pear tomatoes with lemon olive oil) and I get the Caesar salad. while waiting for the appetizers, we munched on the bread and this delicious pesto-type dip. The appetizers are here, yay! What a big let down. \\n\\nLet's start with the Tuna Tartare: the description said it was a spicy fresh tuna with a balsamic reduction and micro arugula. It was neither spicy nor fresh. The balsamic reduction was a drizzle on the plate, not even on the tuna. Oh and the micro arugula consisted of a sprinkle of little teeny-tiny leaves, so that was true to the description.\\n\\nThe salads were basic, nothing special about them.\\n\\nOur waiter comes and asks how our food is. We tell him that the tuna does not taste fresh and it's pretty much a disgusting dish. He asks if we want the kitchen to make a new. Hmm, let me see. . . that would be a no! We asked for something completely different and off he went. The new appetizers were Crab Cakes and a Caprese salad. The salad was good, the crab cakes were not. We didn't say anything else because we feared that our food would get spit on.\\n\\nThe entrees come and we all look at each other not know what to expect and hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Sadly, that was not the case. We ordered the following: Veal Milanese, Prosciutto Pizza, Pasta with chicken and NY steak with a peppercorn brandy cream sauce.\\n*sigh*\\n\\nThe veal was crusted with  panko bread crumbs but it was so dry, cutting it was next to impossible.  Presentation wise, the pasta was a big mess but it was edible. The pizza was nice and crispy with a generous amount of prosciutto and an even more generous amount of arugula. Upon first impression, the steak looked good. However, when trying to cut it, it disappointed. I say \\\"trying\\\" because it was so tough, I had to struggle with it. It was then that I realized I was using a butter knife so I asked for a steak knife. I thought that would solve the cutting issue but again, that was not the case. I could not cut a piece for the life of me. I was arm wrestling it, no joke. The manager happened to stop by as I am doing that and asks how our food was. (I assume he heard about the tuna tartare) I tell him my steak is so tough I can't even cut it with the steak knife. So he asks if he can try to cut me a piece. Even HE struggled with it but played it off like I wasn't cutting it right. He then has the nerve to ask me what was wrong with. Really? He suggest maybe cooking it a little bit more (it was med-rare) and I tell him that that's not the problem. The problem was the big tendon-nerve running through the whole meat. I tell him that I don't want it and do not want anything else in its place. Boy was he mad! He took it and said nothing.\\n\\nNot once, did he apologize or even PRETEND to feel bad for our experience. Quite frankly, we felt that we were the inconvenience and not the other way around. To be honest, we felt a bit disrespected for having spoken up. With so many restaurants and so many choices, one would think that they would go out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one. Our waiter never came back, that's how bad it was.\\n\\nI hope that although a bit long, my review helps you in deciding whether to patronize this restaurant."}

That being said, there is definitely power in numbers, and because of all these great reviews about Fez, I will definitely go back and give it another chance. My husband and I went here on Friday for happy hour. The atmosphere was definitely sleek and fun - I loved the colors and lighting, and the big windows looking out on Central definitely gave the whole place a real urban vibe. Since it was happy hour, 2-4-1 margaritas were our beverage of choice - he tried the citrus and I tried the melon. They were definitely refreshing (and cheap at the equivalent of $3.50 each), but they were a little sweet for our tastes. We planned to go elsewhere that night for dinner, so we decided to try just one appetizer. We selected the Chicken Phyllo Packets. They were just ok. The ingredients were all high-quality, and the portion was large for an affordably priced appetizer (~$8), but the flavor of the feta was overwhelming and we could barely taste the red pepper and chicken. For the price we paid for two drinks and an appetizer (~$17), we got to sit  and enjoy a lively after-work scene and we definitely had a good time. I hope that next time we go back, we experience the magic that is FEZ - I don't want to miss out!"}

Next Rudy helped us pick our entree's and told us about a chicken piccata that wasn't even on the menu! So I got the chicken piccata and my friend got the chicken carciofi. Both dishes were amazing. We asked Ryan about the desserts they hand and he informed us that the cheesecake is made locally and was amazing, so we ordered that and he did not lie! I asked for some extra strawberry sauce and instead Rudy hand cut fresh strawberries for us! Over all Rudy and Ryan made the visit amazing! The food, the cocktails and dessert was beyond exceptional. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}

{"label":0,"text":"We went to this place twice in two days and my experience there is what made me give it this rating:\\n\\nPOSITIVE\\nWhen I stepped into this place I was really amazed with the setup and layout of it. All over the place are plush areas to sit down with a ton of TVs to watch everything all over the place. In the main area there is a huge screen (like someone mentioned 40' x 20' screen) with stadium seating. All around the back there other nicely furnished rooms with more big screen TVs and the like.\\n\\nThe other good thing about this place was our service. On both occasions our servers were very attentive and always checked on us and asked if we needed anything. Even the backup servers helped us out whenever we needed anything as well.\\n\\nNEGATIVE\\nOn our first occasion here we were led on a little tour and then seated in the \\\"Sapphire Room\\\" towards the back of the place. Like I said earlier it was nicely furnished and there was a pool table in there. We were sitting in there having a good time for about twenty minutes and had gotten our first round of drinks when our waitress asked us if we knew that it was a $40 spending minimum PER PERSON for us to sit in that particular room! No one had mentioned this when we were first seated so we were pretty taken aback when we heard this. As we only wanted to have a few drinks and watch basketball we decided to take ourselves out of this section to an area where there was no preset spending limit. Granted I know you need to spend some kind of money when you're watching sports in bars, but this was absurdly high.\\n\\nThe food we had here, while it wasn't bad, it was pretty mediocre.\\n-On our first trip here we had the cheese fries. The fries were only OK, but what really set this appetizer back was the fact that they dumped like cheese whiz cheese on it or that rubbery cheese you get with your nachos from 7-11. How hard is it to get shredded cheddar and micro or heat it so that it melts on the fries?\\n-The second meal I had at this place were their \\\"40\/40 burgers\\\" which essentially is their version of sliders. Nothing to write home about either. I asked for them to be done medium and they were pretty charred when I got them. Twelve dollars for three little burgers that were overcooked? Once again, just OK.\\n-Some of the other meals that I saw but didn't try were their pizzas. It looked like something that came from the freezer section at the supermarket, like Aunty Celeste's pizzas or something. They didn't look that appetizing and no one really said much about them so I assume they weren't that great either.\\n-Drinks were kinda pricey too.\\n\\nNow for the really bad part of our whole experience. We had a group of eight of us when we came and one of our buddies who set the thing up had called in to make reservations for us to having prime seating in this place. When we get their this big bouncer tells us that making reservations \\\"doesn't really mean anything.\\\" That's all well and good I guess, now if they only took all that stuff about making reservations off their website then.\\n\\nSo the next thing he tells us is that \\\"if you take care of me, I'll take care of you.\\\"  And so my friend who set up the whole thing was like OK, fine, so he shelled out $60 for us to get prime seating. What does our bouncer guy do, he goes into the prime seating area and kicks out a few guys that are sitting in there  so that we can sit down. After we get in there we find out that there's not enough space for our group to sit down, so we have to talk to our \\\"friend\\\" one more time to find us a space that we all can fit in. Luckily he found us an open corner where we could all sit, but unfortunately two of us didn't have ANY view of a television set whatsoever.\\n\\nAfter this whole seating thing, we were kinda rubbed the wrong way. At the end of the night we wanted to talk to the manager about what had happened and finally after about twenty minutes of talking to people we finally got the attention of the manager (who really didn't look or feel like a manager from the way she was dressed). Essentially she told us to come back tomorrow as they have to review tapes and talk to people to find out exactly what happened. Seeing as how we were headed somewhere else already we said we would come back the next day to hopefully resolve everything.\\n\\nI was less than confident that things would be resolved the next day, but when we went back to 40\/40 the next day we went in and the bouncer guy that took our money came up to us, said the manager wanted him to talk to us and apologize for what happened last night and he even gave us our money back. While it was great that he did this it didn't seem too sincere and I was actually surprised that the manager didn't come out to talk to us to make sure this whole thing was resolved.\\n\\nIn the end we'll probably not go to this place again. Like other Yelpers have said this place doesn't know what it wants to be. Sorry Jay-Z, cool place, but not a cool experience."}

Either for a cup of coffee or a bag of jerky. People watching is also fun."}
{"label":0,"text":"Oh the horror!  By far, this may have been one of the worst shows I have ever seen in Vegas.  From about 10 minutes in, I was waiting for the pain and suffering to end.  There is no consistent theme, I've never heard any of the music before, the comedian has lost his touch, and it was just a really low grade and bad show.  I am such a fan of Angela and Matt - they really broke new ground 10 years ago when they opened the original X at the Alladin - all of the girls were smokin hot, in their early 20s, and did really naughty things on stage.  I love that Meeka moved over to this show and she's one of the cutest showgirls in Vegas, but man, if she was in her early 20s in the original X, um, should she still be doing the circuit?  I love you Meeka, so don't take it negatively, I just think you could move up and get into choreography and production yourself.  Besides Meeka's beautiful face, the rest of the show was a major flop.  Angela and Matt's daughter gave it a good try, but let's be real, you re-used a lot of the concepts from X Burlesque and just executed it way way worse.  Even the old Showgirls show at Rio had some production value; this show was just amateur and bad.  I feel awful badmouthing a Stabile show, but it's because you guys set the bar so high ten years ago, and even you know this doesn't cut it."}
{"label":1,"text":"My second worst crepe experience ever!\\n\\nI ordered a cheese and prosciutto crepe. The crepe was almost thick as a pancake and really doughy. I like doughy crepes but they should be much thinner. It was also not very hot. The prosciutto was too thick and it was kind of too strong in flavor. Worst of all are the flimsy forks they give you. I had a hell of a time trying to cut the prosciutto.\\n\\nMy BF ordered a decent veggie crepe. Mushroom and spinach I think. This crepe was also doughy and thick. If it were not for this decent crepe I would give this place one star.\\n\\nThe coffee here is awful. I will never return.\\n\\nParking is a breeze usually and it's free. It's in the Paris parking structure.\\n\\nWhen we got here it was not too busy but when we passed by later on it was really packed.

I still have dreams about those crab legs (get them steamed, and they're already cut in half for you). The first time i had the rib-eye steak i was in heaven, perfectly cooked and juicy. The second time however it seemed like it was hardly cooked at all, i get that most people like medium rare but I'm more of a medium guy, so to each their own. The sushi was rather disappointing, not enough selection and not tasty. Overall I thought everything I tried was good, if maybe a little over hyped."}
{"label":0,"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge.  We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros.  We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor.  We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner.  The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.  The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat.  We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks.  The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time.  There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant.  Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back."}
{"label":2,"text":"I would have to say that overall, it was just OK. I got the fish and fries. The fish was really oily, and the longer it set on my plate the soggier it got. The twisted potato appetizer was really good. My husband ordered some chicken wings with the buffalo sauce. For 79 cents apiece, they were really small chicken wings. My husband made a comment that they must be from cornish hens. Our meal total with drinks was $33. The service was good."}

{"label":2,"text":"The current rating on this place, as of 5\/23\/14, is three and a half stars. This is about right for King's Fish House. \\n\\nWe started out with the calamari. The portion seemed about right but the breading was fragile. It came off easily and also tasted a little oily. Food Network told me that could happen due to the oil not being hot enough. \\n\\nMy dining companion ordered the lobster bisque, which was missing a certain je ne sais quoi... He asked for the bisque to be replaced with a clam chowder and that, too, wasn't very good. It tasted under seasoned and floury. I figure if you are going to call yourself a fish house, then you should have a pretty epic clam chowder...\\n\\nMy cioppino was very tasty and well worth the cost. The crab claws were my favorite part but the broth brought it all together. I would order it again. My partner liked his fried shrimp. \\n\\nThe service was good.

{"label":0,"text":"My wife and I went for dinner this evening as we have done many times before. While the dinner was fine and our waiter (who was also tending bar) was excellent our experience was ruined by the to go area of the restaurant.\\n\\nMy wife is the Store Manager of a national chain retail store and frequently treats her staff to lunch. On many occasions she has ordered a total of 6 pizzas to be delivered to the store the next day and it has never been an issue. Unfortunately tonight was different.\\n\\nShe asked the girl behind the counter for an order to be delivered tomorrow to the store but was told \\\"wouldn't you rather order tomorrow so it would be fresh?\\\". I am not sure if she thought we wanted it cooked tonight and delivered tomorrow but that was not the real problem. She went to the back to ask the Manager on Duty - Paul if they could deliver tomorrow and was told no. Since my wife has done it many times before she asked to speak with the manager. Paul came out and began to make excuses like I don't know how many delivery guys I have tomorrow, the other store may take some of my delivery guys, I already know I have one order,etc. If you already have an order than apparently you do what we were asking.\\n\\nSince this is the age of reality shows, and Metro was actually on one, don't you think that customer service should be crucial to a manager's duties? Paul made an issue out of a normal request. We than left Metro without placing the order and proceeded to another pizzeria and placed the order with them, no issues and no excuses.\\n\\nI doubt my wife will ever place an order with Metro again."}

Fry's is just up the street and we are buying much of our food and supplies there - the room has a fridge and coffee maker, but no microwave.  \\n\\nOur neighbors are active but it hasn't been too much of a problem.

This is a nice place and very low-stress.  The front desk people were exceptionally nice and very helpful in telling us of nearby restaurants.\\n\\nLastly, the southwestern style is of the room adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the place.

{"label":3,"text":"When this place first opened, I used to drive all the way from Green Valley just to come here - I was addicted to the amazing haupia cake (freshly baked at the bakery next door). The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway... \\n\\nI've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch. \\n\\nThe owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake. \\n\\nThey're also open a little later and  7 days a week now. Not sure if they still close for about a month around xmas\/new years though."}

I would say the food is at a 4 now and that is because they dropped the popular desserts off the menu and only have the cotton candy.  Gone is the junk food dessert platter.  They still have items on the buffet portion but none really stood out to me.\\n\\nThe ribs and the apple cinnamon pancakes off the menu were amazing just like last year. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the horrid service we received.  So bad that we asked to speak to a manager when the bill came.  I understand we were a large party and so gratuity was already added which I guess to our main waiter, Kenny, meant that he didn't have to earn it.  Orders were slow, drinks were slow, utensils were slow.  Someone in our party waited 20 minutes for a fork.  Toward the end one of the birthday host found the alcohol and took over serving duties.  It was deja vu from last year.  \\n\\nManagers excuse was they were short staffed.  I don't want to hear excuses.  Kenny should have mentioned that when we first seated.  He could have left pitchers of water, tea, extra utensils on the table to alleviate his burden.  Last year the server left the champagne bucket and we served ourselves.  \\n\\nFINAL WARNING:  PAY WITH CASH or Simons will hijack your bank account.  It has now been four days and they still have a hold on my account for a bottomless brunch I didn't order for $77.  It's not necessarily the amount but the principle.  I was also charged $51 for the alcohol free brunch which is what was my bill should have been.   I called and talked to the manager and he said it happens pretty frequently.  I understand holds but charging me for an entire meal I didn't order is out of line.  Again, just excuses."}

The first night we checked in because we didn't make it by 4 PM, they gave us a room with two queens instead of a king as we requested. Instead of honoring it, they kept trying to upcharge us to move to the north tower for $30 a night, but why would we pay an extra $30 when we only paid $39 in the first place?!\\n\\nThe front desk was extremely slow for check in and check out. They weren't very friendly and not accommodating at all. I guess part of the cheap rates is the service too. The rooms are outdated and it shows.

{"label":0,"text":"This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \\n\\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \\n\\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \\\"testing\\\" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \\\"Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\\\"  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \\n\\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \\\"loosening up nicely\\\" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \\n\\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \\\"drink lots of water\\\" and I thought to myself, \\\"For what?\\\"  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \\n\\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."}

{"label":2,"text":"So the 2 for 1 deal for dining at TI buffet was pointless, since the front desk told me it is valid after 11am. It was 9am and I wanted to eat before I head on out to the airport. $15 a person wasn't so bad coming from a buffet that I thought it was average. Average price, average quality for TI buffet. I noticed how it looked nice and clean inside for an average buffet. Right when we were seated, our server served us our drinks and he was occupied somewhere else without checking up on us. There was fresh made omelette and side dishes on the side near by (french toast, pancakes, sausages, hash brown). The omelette was good, but not as much as I enjoyed at the Lago Buffet at Caesar's Palace. I remember the french toast was very plain in taste. The parfait was really good (plain yogurt at the based topped with cantaloupe and melon and granola bits). There was also a small sushi section, but I thought most sushi from buffets tastes similar to each other. There were also a pastry section with mini donuts! As I was getting full, I just had to get at least one mini donut. It was just so cute in its size, but perfect and good for me to end my meal! This is a place that I would consider average, but I disagree how others think it's so horrible when it's not that bad."}
{"label":2,"text":"I am trying to broaden my Thai food horizons as my normal stop (Siri Thai) has become awful at answering the phone.\\n\\nThis place is somewhat near me and had decent reviews, so I tried it out for a weekend to-go lunch.  I ordered the tofu pad Thai spicy 3 (their scale is 1-10) over the phone and the lady said, \\\"It will be ready in 5 minutes.\\\"\\n\\nEep!  I had to throw on some pants and leave because the drive is a little bit longer than that.  Certainly not the worst problem in the world, though.\\n\\nThe location is easy-to-find and I parked right in the front.  The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, clean and overall a nice atmosphere.  I saw my order was right on the counter, so I paid with the friendly lady and left.\\n\\nThe tofu is certainly superior to Siri Thai but I think it's still lacking a little bit of that tofu texture that I personally enjoy.  The pad Thai was lacking peanuts but the overall flavor was good and the heat was there but certainly not overwhelming - exactly what I wanted.  There was a bit of a citrus flavor that I simply don't like with my pad Thai, but it was much more subtle than other places I've tried.  Also, they were generous with egg and green onion which I love!\\n\\nWhile I have not found my new pad Thai spot (damn you, Siri Thai), I think I have found a new place to put into my pickup regime.  The pictures of pad see ew look delicious and I still need to try their Thai tea as I feel that's necessary at ANY Thai place.  -:3"}

We also ordered the roasted eggplant dip with pita and that was pretty good. We then ordered the salmon, sea bass and a side of asparagus, heeding the waitresses warning about how small the servings were. We couldn't really taste the asparagus because they were pretty burnt, and the salmon came out pretty raw (I ordered it medium). The seabass seemed okay. I would probably go back here for drinks because the bar area looked pretty cool, and in the outside area where we ate they had couches and it was a cool lounge area.

Bringing me to disappointment #1: I received no reminder call saying \\\"Hey your appt is tomorrow, blah blah blah\\\". Now I know it's MY appointment and they may have been busy but isn't it sort of the front desk persons job to call patients and remind them of scheduled appointments. Not such a big deal though. So, moving on.\\n\\nDisappointment #2: The doctor had NO people skills at all. He just wanted to get this over with. I told him this was my 1st ever eye exam you'd think he'd at least let me know what's going on before sticking this and that in my eye. But no. All I got was a sit still, open your eyes, look up. I mean come on dude YOU'RE STICKING A FREAKIN LIGHT IN MY EYE. At least give a girl a heads up and all. It just would have been nice to have a little warning like \\\"Hey, I'm going to have you look all over the place while I stick this uncomfortable rather bright light in your eye, do your best to stay as still as possible and keep your eyes open\\\". But no I received nothing of the sort.\\n\\nThen he puts these drops in my eyes and has me sit out in the waiting room. I had no idea why, so as I'm sitting there and my eyes begin to feel more and more awkward, I start to freak out a little. \\\"Is this whats suppose to happen? Why can't I see? Oh no something's wrong\\\". After being ushered to another exam room I come to find out that all that is normal, it's actually what was expected to happen. Thanks for the HEADS UP DOC. So then the doc comes back in with another damn light to stick in my eyes. Then he rambles off all this technical eye jargon that pretty much left me with a big fat \\\"HUH\\\". But I think I got the gist of it.\\n\\nSo now brings me to the disappointment #3 (the big one): I go to the front desk, pay my copay, no big deal then the front desk gentleman asked me if I had sunglasses, to which my reply was yes in the car. That was it. Nothing else. I had NO IDEA until I stepped out into the Arizona sun, scratch that the Arizona HOT BRIGHT AS HELL sun, to figure out why the gentleman asked me if I has sunglasses. Oh my god! A little warning that it was going to feel and look as though I was WALKING ON THE SUN would have been nice. I mean come on people! I couldn't see a damn thing until I got all the way back to my car and put my sunglasses on. My eyes were dilated for the next few hours, which would have also been nice to have been told about. I wouldn't have tried to go back to work had I know that little tid bit of info.\\n\\nI gave a two because all in all, I got my eye exam over with so that was good. The doctor seemed like he knew what he was doing, so that was good. The office itself was rather nice looking. And I'm in a good mood this morning. I'm just used to a more friendly office visit. I wish they would have just talked to me is all. Is that too much to ask for?"}

{"label":3,"text":"CLT is a convenient airport despite being a rather busy hub, with a fair amount of international traffic.  When I used to fly US Airways all the time, CLT would figure in my travel at least once a week.  Now, it's rare that I get to go through CLT.\\n\\nIt's a fairly new airport and the layout and amenities show that.  It has a wide open, airy feel to it in most concourses, especially the International concourse.  The central area where the B and C concourses meet can be a bit of a madhouse at times with people rushing between gates.  But there, in the midst of all this traffic, are dozens of cozy Adirondack style chairs where you can relax for a bit if you have the time between flights.\\n\\nThere is often some live entertainment in the central area... grand piano, country music, jazz - I've seen it all.  Lots of food options too - and a full fledged cigar\/tobacco store - woohoo!!!\\n\\nWeather in the area is usually good which means minimal flight delays.  Delays are inevitable in a hub airport but when they do happen, CLT makes the experience a little less stressful by providing a lot of distractions in addition to the wonderful Southern charm of all the people working here.\\n\\nGreat place to connect if you're headed to the Caribbean - you're almost there already ;)\\n\\n~ 4 solid stars for a solid, dependable and charming \\\"little\\\" big airport.  CLT may not be my favorite airport but it's one I'm quite fond of.\\n\\n# 280"}

This was a great start to an awesome night.\\n\\nI went with low expectations based on the poor reviews from yelp.  But maybe this place turned it around because the service was EXCELLENT.  My group took advantage of Happy Hour and had the cheese dip, avocado rolls, and quesadilla.  Everything was really freaking good and they had a great selection of Mexican beers on draft.  I was impressed by the selection of vegetarian entrees.  I ordered the broccoli enchiladas and chile relleno.  The food was fresh and full of flavor.

About 10 minutes to get someone to the table.  About 10 minutes to get a drink.  Had to ask for the soda I ordered twice.  It showed after being there for more than 20+ minutes.

{"label":2,"text":"I came here last night with a friend.  We were originally planning to go to Piper's Pub in the South Side, but his car was unavailable, so he asked if we could go somewhere in Squirrel Hill or Oakland, and this is what we chose.\\n\\nWe each ordered one cone ($4.99 each)--I ordered the white pizza one, and he ordered the Mediterranean.  Staff was quite friendly and conversational, though kind of wishy-washy when my friend asked for a flavor recommendation.  Our cones took between 10-15 min. to cook, but we were the only people ordering at that time (6:30 on a Mon.).  When they came up, we were hoping to sit at one of the two tables outside, but each of the tables had a person sitting and loitering at it.  I found this slightly annoying since it was clear that neither of these people had bought anything, and tables (incl. outside ones) should be reserved for paying customers.  So we ended up sitting inside across from a table of noisy high school students.\\n\\nMy white pizza cone was filled with the toppings you'd expect on a white pizza: mozzarella, ricotta, and broccoli.  Though I'm a white pizza aficionado, I was underwhelmed by the flavor of my cone, which I found bland and insufficiently savory.  I think this was due to the ratio of cheese being off (too much ricotta).  Having said that, my cone was quite filling (I didn't regret not ordering a second), and was served at just the right temperature (hot but edible).  My friend enjoyed his Mediterranean cone, which he said contained quite a few olives, though it was served hotter than mine, so it was difficult for him to eat (even after he'd reached the middle after several minutes, it was still steaming).\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or an inexpensive meal, I'd recommend checking this place out.  Based on my review and others, there are some kinks the ownership needs to work out, but they have an interesting product.  I'd return, but I think I'd try another flavor next time, such as the pepperoni or Hawaiian.  3.5 stars."}

The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.\\n\\nAt Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers. \\n\\nThe service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal.

The wait is ridiculous, but if you have $$$ get bottle service, or if you have homies in Vegas with hook ups, call them!  It is definitely worth the hassle.  You want to look good, dress sexy, and bring lots of cash and credit to buy drinks.  Drinks cost lots...but everywhere in vegas its muy expensive!  This place has one of the largest patios near their pool to chill, smoke, meet people, and chat throughout the long hours of the night til dawn.  The dance floor is pretty big too, not too crowded.  It opens up into the patio area, so the place is well ventilated.   You can even dip your feet in the pool if it starts sweating in your sandals to rid of any vinegar smell you may have developed haha.  Vegas always has a good diverse crowd with a DJ who places music to fit everyone's taste.  I think the fact that this place is huge, and the patio is huge, and the fact that everyone wants to go somewhere new, this place is definitely the spot!  \\n\\nPlanning a bachelorette or bachelor party? do it here.  My girl and I met so many people about to get married and had their bottle service there.  Its super expensive so be ready to let go of some ends!  It was even fun with just me and my girlfriend, dancing the night away, walking around and chit chatting w\/ everyone.  The main thing is, you CAN walk around, you CAN see people, AND even better, no long lines to go pee!  It's not super crowded or dark like Tao.

In many ways, it is very similar to other Courtyard by Marriott locations.  It has complimentary parking, complimentary internet and a 24 hr fitness center.\\n\\nThe rooms are okay.  While the lobby has been renovated to showcase the new Courtyard by Marriott lobby design (the bistro, the market, the modern seating, etc.), the rooms felt a little dated.  The rooms were still big enough and comfortable enough.\\n\\nThere were definitely areas where this hotel did not stand up well against other Courtyard Marriotts.  The internet was a little slow.  They do warn you when you log-in and you do have an option of paying an extra charge for fast internet.\\n\\nAlso, the hallways had a smell to them.  While Courtyard by Marriott is a smoke-free hotel, probably the years when smoking was allowed or simply the proximity to Vegas has resulted in kind of a smoky smell in the hallways.\\n\\nService was fine.  Prices were not too bad, but you could probably pay a relatively similar amount for a mid-range hotel on The Strip (like Bally's) if you planned ahead.\\n\\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is probably a step below other Courtyard by Marriott hotels out there.  Also, its location is convenient only if you are spending time a lot of time at the convention center.  If you are planning to spend most of your time on The Strip, it is not that far from the Wynn\/Encore, but it is very far from everything else.  If you are coming to Las Vegas for vacation, you should probably try to look online at some of the lower priced hotels (Bally's, Mirage) before settling for this Courtyard by Marriott.\\n\\nAs mentioned, this Courtyard by Marriott offers free parking; the parking is outside, but it is gated."}

The jalape\\u00f1o bacon had just the right amount of heat and although there was some sort of remoulade-like mayo it was perfect and not overpowering. If you've read some of my previous reviews you know how I feel about food arriving IMMEDIATELY after ordering and it being lukewarm. After the order was put in 3 minutes later my food was brought to the table. The BLT looked amazing,  but the fries looked like Ursula's \\\"poor unfortunate souls\\\" from The Little Mermaid. They were shriveled, withered, and. ..... (GULP)..... cold. I knew they were probably the last of the precooked batch. I tried to suck it up, but I couldn't because each fry was so disappointing. I let the server know and he brought a fresh new batch. When I bit into it, steam came out and I smiled like a little kid. They were amazing, and I had no guilt eating them. Although I cut my sandwich in half and anticipated getting a TO GO container,  I devoured the other half effortlessly. With each bite,  I watched the \\\"cool crowd\\\" shake hands, make business deals, and laugh heartily at each others witty humor. It was surely a frequent flyer guest list.

I was a bit hesitant on the cold soup, but on a humid day, it really helps to perk up your appetite. \\n\\nThe stew was good with a hearty serving size and a rich broth.

Something however that shocked me was when I needed to cancel my flight, they made it such hassle free. All I remember was before with AA that I went through such loop holes to try to cancel a flight and they charged me fees on top of overprices tickets. But with Southwest, I was able to call the night before to cancel my flight and they send me a confirmation right away. I just used those credits to rebook another flight and I got the low prices offered on the site and there was no charge to rebook. Excellent service and motto. I will always fly southwest if I can!"}

Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch.

But you probably won't be able to get in the pool because it's packed.  You probably won't be able to get a lounge chair, because it's packed.  There's no refuge from the sun unless you want to pay - not kidding - $2500 (\\\"we can talk about $1000\\\") - for a cabana.  Most disturbing of all was the exacting search for drugs we all had to undergo.  Why?  Apparently this joint has some issues with GHB (aka the date rape drug), that's per one of the security guards.  I never got to the point of ordering a drink because we decided to bail.  Thank god we were on the guest list, because I'm sure I would have felt obligated to stay had I paid the absurd entrance fee.\\n\\nPS - if you're staying at MGM, where Wet Republic is, go to the MGM pool!

{"label":2,"text":"The good first.  I ordered the crab ravioli and the hubs ordered a wedge salad.  Both meals were delicious.  They brought out a basket of various breads including garlic knots.  That was a definite plus, I love variety not to mention the offerings were delectable.  I also ordered a tiramisu to-go.  The tiramisu was okay.  I prefer it with chocolate liqueur sauce but they use cocoa powder as a garnish instead.  \\n\\nNow the bad.  The wait.  I understand they were moderately busy and the place is quite small but waiting for 15 minutes after receiving our drinks just to order is a bit on the ridiculous side.  If they were staffed properly this would not be an issue as I saw only one server running around the entire restaurant and she was quite rushed with everything.  They really should have a backup server during busy times.  Or at the very least have who I suspected was the bartender help out rather than stand around and watch the dining room.  \\n\\nOne thing that I found humorously interesting is when the server took my drink order.  I ordered a Mr. Pibb after seeing it on the website's menu.  She comes back with the hubs drink but quickly tells me that they don't have Mr. Pibb and hands me the beer menu asking me to choose another drink.  I quickly ordered a root beer instead which she hastily obliged.  The hubs and I couldn't help but giggle that she didn't realize that Mr. Pibb is a soda, not a beer.  \\n\\nSo in conclusion, the food is good but they need to be staffed properly."}

Now it's just a dated store with an annoying elevator. The ambiance is cold, starting with the cheesy fruit pictures outside. Dated and sad. This neighborhood needs a grocery store with local,organic produce, natural cleaning products like Method, and meat\/seafood from small companies that take special care with the animals and the earth. Maybe the wine bar has potential in nice weather...outdoor tables...overlooking The Intersection of Many Crashes. But it might be nice out there. Wine, with small plates?

{"label":1,"text":"I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:\\n\\nPad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.\\n\\nPad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.\\n\\nTom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.\\n\\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food."}

Tried to evaluate and diagnose what was wrong with him then eventually he got tested and thank God the results came out negative. Turns out he was just feeling sick from the fluff he chewed up and ate from his bed. We figured that out when Dr. Cantwell was taking a stool sample from him and found a string of fluff from his butt. But I guess that's when I really started to like Dr. Cantwell. She was amazing with him. She's was nice, sincere, and helpful. The staff members are also nice and welcoming. Second time I came here was just a follow up on how he was doing and to get his 12 week shots, and still got the same welcoming warm treatment. I have no problem with her or this clinic. Some of these reviews talk about how all they care about is money which I can totally see that.

Coffee was average.  \\nI was a little disappointed to see they were getting rid of the military discount.  I would be curious to know why they aren't going to have that anymore.  A 20% discount is minimal considering the service they provide to our country.  Also, every time I've ever been at Aliante, it is crawling with service people.  It would seem to me, it'd be a better marketing strategy to get those large groups of people in, rather than not.  I'm sure it was an incentive to have them come in...without it, Aliante will just be another casino and the Original Pancake House is just another place to have breakfast.  There's plenty of places to choose from.  Ie:  The Cannery.....very service person friendly, and pretty sure it's closer to Nellis."}

My burger was good, juicy and tender, Her remade salmon was very good, and he sweet potato pancakes were a nice touch.  They comped the salmon, which was nice.

An orange and soda will sting you over 3 quid and the guiness tastes like water. And on the 364 non-sunny days of the year you will be drinking inside, which is so so. Don't get me wrong, it's quite pleasant, but nothing special with no great draw.

When we were heading out a guy walked out yelling \\\"Horrible, horrible\\\" to everyone in earshot. It was...well, bad. We didn't see any sign of Ne-Yo until after midnight, and by then he was so f'ed up that everything he said and sang was just pathetic. For $100\/guy and $50\/girl, all they did was blow paper confetti at midnight. The entire experience lacked anything special. With that fat of a cover and no live music performance by your headliner, you should at least hand out some cheap champagne. \\n\\n3 shots of well vodka and a vodka martini were $56. The entire club (which has multiple rooms of different styles of music and no real room to dance in any of them) has donated all possible space to VIP booths. Many of those are nowhere near the action, so you have to get up and leave, making your booth susceptible to theft. I don't recommend bottle service at this club. I'm glad we didn't go for it. If you aren't a VIP, however, good luck finding anywhere so much to even lean, as they've profit-maximized every square inch of the interior. \\n\\nAdditionally, so many people were chain smoking within an area of so little ventilation that I became literally sick to my stomach and had to excuse myself from the club entirely. I'm pretty used to the nasty smoking liberty people in Vegas abuse, but this was a little overboard. \\n\\nMusic was house\/EDM samples, nothing Top 40 or dancey. Nothing unique to the DJ stack at all - you'll find these types of mixes anywhere. Pretty weak. Pro's of the club were the bouncers\/security (who I found to actually be pretty accommodating), the cleanliness, and the multi-room concept.

The teas are pretty decent, the espresso drinks are almost always good, and the house blend coffee is delicious. Some might argue that point, but they're just wrong and\/or dumb. It's delicious. During the summer, when they offer it, the peach rooibos tea is probably the best tea I've ever had (and I work in a tea shop so I know my tea) - get it and love it. Well, just get it. You will love it.\\n\\nIn terms of atmosphere, well, it depends what you want in a coffeeshop. Some of the regulars are super elitist hipster types, as are some of the employees. But at least as many of each groups are wonderful people. Did I meet my best friends there? No. But I did meet some cool people to add on Myspace or Friendster or whatever, and I was able to chat with them and have fun. The music is, by and large, great. It's pretty typical indie rock fare, but it's still generally good. If you don't like the stuff on the O.C. (because it's that kind of indie rock) or Pitchfork (it's also that kind), bring your own music.\\n\\nSo, the food offerings are always an important factor when people come into the place I work, and while I choose coffeeshops based on coffee, I know that not everyone else is the same way. The food is so-so. The cookies and brownies and everything are good, because hello they're cookies and brownies and stuff! They used to have these really amazing peanut butter brownies, but the recipe changed or something - they're not the same. The black and white cookie is so good though! Get that one when they have it. It's like the food version of the peach rooibos iced tea."}

I would argue that they really need to get that redesigned for increased readability. \\n\\n\\nI decided to go with the classic chicken and waffles. When this plate came out the potion was massive for less than $20. Two large pieces of fried chicken (mostly breast, but a little bone existed). 4 thick Belgium waffles. A smorgasbord of topping and plating arrangement to make it look sexy. \\n\\nThe syrup was light and really enjoyable. I loved cramming the chicken, waffle, and syrup combo into my mouth.

The smoked sausage starter was really outstanding. I am German and well versed on smoked sausage. It was sour, and perfect. \\n\\nI enjoyed the French onion soup which was mostly bubbling cheese (yum) and a delicious rosemary infused broth. There were chunks fo pork in it which I found detracted from the soup. Still, really good. \\n\\nSpecial tuna \\\"handroll\\\" with chopped tuna, nori, rice, fish eggs and quail egg. Ridiculous. Best handroll I have ever had. \\n\\nMy main was a special, a tuna with eggplant and tomato. It was really good, albiet slightly overcooked. The SO had a pot of various pig bits on mashed potato. he liked it other than the blood sausage which he found only ok (although just recently back from a Blood fueled fiesta in Germany) We were too full to finish and unable to at 1am. The two mains were amazing fresh form the hotel room fridge the next morning.\\n\\nWine was good, beer selection ok. We had a good meal. Kinda pricey, keep that in mind. And reservations... book early."}

After visiting some of the other venues on the strip, Circus Circus seemed a bit outdated.  If you are looking for food  and don't really care about the atmosphere, or quality go for it.

{"label":1,"text":"I love Fry's. I really do. Way better then Best Buy for so many reasons. I can spend hours in the store and I'm not even that big of a nerd. Started my trip tonight by looking at video games. Almost bought one, but I decided not to. I was here for a reason. \\nNext stop is car stereos. I've been wanting a new one with an aux connection. Now they have aux connections and usb in stereos? Amazing! Where have I been? Took about 15 minutes for someone to come and assist me with looking at the car stereos and tell me which one would work best. I know these employees have to make commission, but I was impressed that he did not try to sell me something I didn't need or want. He actually recommended a very low cost stereo for me.  Satisfied. \\nNext, networking. I needed a few items. I needed a wireless router. Well I was told by a friend beforehand which router I should get  (I sure love knowing lots of nerds). This guy is trying to sell me something else that is $40 more. I live in a fairly small house. I'm typically in the living room. I have no need for a huge router. Then he tries to sell me another brand, because its sells more. He couldn't explain to me why it is better, it has the same specs, its just a better seller. Then he starts to tell me about his at home. Still can't explain why it could be better. Ok, no thanks, I will stick with the one that has already been recommended to me by someone who knows what they are talking about. Next, I need a cord. A VGA to a RGB with audio. He starts searching in a bunch of aisles, asking other people for help. He can't find it. I show him a link and picture from their website, searches some more. Nope, not happening.  Asks me if I've looked in some other part of the store. No, I haven't. Maybe he should help me with that. Probably not.  Next, I would like an external hard drive. Simple enough. Ok. go over there. Starts showing me one that is $170. Its 500 gigs. Well, look, there's the same brand, same gigs for $100, just smaller, thinner, cuter. What's different mister employee? Why such a price difference. He has no idea. Whatever, I will just pick this one. His answer to almost everything is that I can return it if I need to. Why should I have to waste my time bringing something back and returning it? Shouldn't I just get the right answers right now? \\nOk, I'm done shopping. I could spend more in this wonderful store, but I should be getting home. He brings me up front to check out, and so I don't have to wait in line. He's gonna make sure he gets his commission and no one else tries to take it. \\nAlmost done checking out when another employee, obviously a friend of his walks up and starts laughing about selling something. It sounds as if they are mocking a customer for buying something ridiculous and overpriced perhaps. They are talking about the money they are making and how cute the lady customer was. They walk away, I mention to the cashier how rude, inappropriate and unprofessional all that was to do in front of a customer. She didn't give 2 shits what I had to say either. \\nI will return, because it is one of the most amazing places ever, however, beware of the employees. They suck. They are commissioned. They will try to sell you things you don't need, don't want and are too pricey. Try and go in there knowing what you want already. You won't get very good answers because the employees have no idea what they are talking about. I'm hoping you will  have a nerdy friend. Do research online first, ask a friend, or shop somewhere else if you truly have no idea."}

The weekend we were there, the B52s and Blondie performed at the Mandalay Bay beach Saturday night!  Tickets were $60, but were discounted for guests staying at the Mandalay for a discounted price of $33!  The concert was great!  Especially the B52s!  They play on the stage next to the wave pool.  They shut the waves down and clear all the lounge chairs from the beach.  We watched the concert in the pool right in front of the stage!  It was awesome!\\nNow for the rooms.  The rooms are spacious and so was the bathroom, with double sinks and a separate room for the toilet - nice touch - and a separate shower stall and jacuzzi tub.

They serve it with a large bowl of chips.  I always ask for a side of soft corn tortillas too, they are a nice change from the chips. \\n\\nThe Plato Appertivo is gigantic, you could feed four people with this thing.  The nachos, ribs and quesadillas were all fantastic.  There is a generous scoop of their great guacamole on top and a bowl of salsa on the side.  You might want to ask for the chipotle sour cream on the side rather than on the quesadillas - it has a great smoky taste but can dominate easily so I prefer to regulate the portion.\\n\\nThe enchiladas and soft tacos are very good.

the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.\\n\\nAcknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.\\n\\nTreated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would \\\"space out the pastas\\\" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.\\n\\nSpeaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature \\\"jar\\\" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.\\n\\nPairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'\\n\\nTipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point."}

Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.  \\nWe had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical.\\nAt the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.  \\nNo such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \\\"I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\\\"  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.  \\n\\nKFC for dinner.\\n\\nA half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \\\"We have your pizza waiting\\\".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.  \\n\\nThen to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.\\n\\nNot done . . .\\n\\nMy daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.\\n\\nOK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.  So I run 20 miles each way to pick-up the same order they had lost at one store and picked it up from another location. \\n\\nYou can get better pizzas from the grocer's freezer.  \\n\\nThe crust is flat, no edge, looks like it was runout on a sheeter (machine that rolls out dough). \\n\\nThe sauce is tasteless, and just that, canned tomato sauce.  \\n\\nThe meats were also bland, who would expect that from a sausage and pepperoni pizza?\\n\\nPeople, this is not good pizza. . .  \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n were"}

Ok you do have to get past the fact it's not the best looking location or even in the best area but this place is a must experience.  I got the Mexican Burger which came with grilled onions, mayo, monterry jack cheese, and green chili's.  I tried a fry first and was amazed I usually don't like the bigger cut fries cause they are never crispy enough but no these fries were the best I've had in a long time.  They came with seasoned salt on them and were just amazing.  I had a milkshake with m&m's which was amazing as well.  I can't say enough about how good this place is.

I just moved to this side of town, and I notice it's lacking flavor, (the area not Tony's.) \\n\\nI ordered 4 carne asada soft tacos, 1 carne asada sope.\\n\\nThe tacos were EXACTLY what I was looking for. The meat was so tasty and juicy with some crunchy bits in it. They were topped with cilantro and onion. They came with some limes and hot sauce. The tacos were waaaay better than Roberto's, which seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in this general area aside from Baja Fresh.\\n\\nThe sope was good too, it had a whole tomato slice on top which was kind of weird but still good. \\n\\nI also got an horchata. I have been craving some homemade horchata so it was only natural I try it out. It was just okay, I think it may have tasted better a few hours prior to my arrival because it was a little watery but you can still taste the milk base and sweetness. \\n\\nAll in all it was 10 dollars for my feast, and it was well worth the price. I got take out so I didn't get to try the chips and salsa, or the service. From what I saw, this place is pretty empty most of the time, the cashier was really friendly and the food comes out fast.

I unfortunately didn't order a burger, I just ordered mozzarella sticks to munch on, while my friend ordered a full meal. The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent, I usually say motsy sticks can be determined by the marinara sauce, if you have good marinara you have good motzy sticks. Their sauce was pretty decent for a burger place, not bad at all! I have to say I wish I did get a burger, for my friend ordered their BBQ\/Bacon burger and it was pretty delicious! Im not a fan of BBQ, but this burger wasn't overpowered with the BBQ sauce. The BBQ taste was a good flavor that added to the burger, bacon and cheese! Gave it a nice little kick! Food was good, staff was decent, stays pretty busy on the weekends and the prices are a little high, but you have to kind of expect that for they are right there in Old Town Scottsdale. Old Town seems to have little higher prices then other restaurants down the streets. Overall A-OK place!"}

Instead of trying to think of something to eat on the strip we decided to stick to the hotel and keep it easy.  We both love sushi, so Ah Sin should have been an easy choice.  Actually it was a big mistake.  \\n\\nIt's a pretty decent atmosphere, but that is all it had going for it.  It took more than five minutes for a server to greet us, even though there were ample amount of staff in the dining room.  When our server did arrive we could not understand him nor could he understand us...oh, this is going to be awesome!\\n\\nMy wife ordered a couple of rolls off the menu and I opted for the all-you-can-eat sushi.  I did order some of the same rolls she did off the all-you-can-eat menu (spicy tuna and shrimp tempura).  When they were served it was obvious something was wrong.  We ordered identical rolls but mine were half the size with twice the rice.  There is good business and then there is just completely screwing your customer, and it was obvious I was getting the royal treatment on this deal.  My tuna rolls tasted off, the shrimp roll had no flavor and the rice was under cooked to boot.  However, the rice in the rolls that my wife ordered was properly cooked, which only makes me ask the questions, \\\"how long ago were my rolls prepared?\\\"  By the time we got back to our room, neither of us were feeling too well.  \\n\\nOut of all the restaurants that we went to on our trip Ah Sin was, by far, the worst experience."}

My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most, although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.\\n\\nTo me, the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins).

{"label":2,"text":"Recently I started going to this Costco when the Business Center stopped selling cigarettes for personal consumption and left this as the only Costco in the West valley that sells cigarettes.  I don't like the layout as well as Arrowhead and because it is out of the way for me I quite often end up going here during busy times instead of weekday evenings when things are a bit quieter.  I just stopped by the morning before Thanksgiving and the place looked like a Saturday afternoon 10 minutes after opening.  And the system for cigarettes places a burden on the rest of the customers who do not smoke by making the entire line wait for somebody to go get the cigarettes.  I'll still keep coming to this one when I need to but I will go to Arrowhead for restocking stuff in the pantry, like the Langers OJ which this location did not have when I looked for it."}

This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.  Beware of the old men at the front as well, they don't seem too excited to have children there."}
{"label":4,"text":"WAIT WAIT WAIT.......... 5 stars for food and beer only @ the BBQ restaurant next to the brewery...\\n\\nOK, Ellis Island is a dump of a casino, it looks old but it has three things going for it...........BBQ baby back ribs, BBQ chicken and onsite brewed beer. They cook the ribs in the parking lot as you enter from Koval.\\n\\nThey brew their own (multiple beers). $1.75 for an 20 ounce glass...... And they make (non alcoholic) root beer too............... I'm hooked on the lite beer.\\n\\nOK, here is my humble opinion. I can drop a $100+ bucks easily on myself for dinner at the right place 7 days a week if I wanted to. I just wanted to be clear that I'm not cheap.\\n\\nEllis Island was mentioned to me about two years ago and I finally went in June 2011. I'm not a fan of BBQ because I don't like the mess and usually the lack of meat on the rib bones. You WON'T have that problem here. For $13, you can get at least an 18 inch+ rack of baby backs, (BBQ beans, slaw, bread and corn on the cob very average). You can also get a rib\/chicken combo. There is a pizza place within spitting distance that serves great pizza by the slice that you can bring to the table (our appetizer).\\n\\nI CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK........... And I'll get two racks of ribs next time because they were that damn good and cheap.\\n\\nBEWARE, IT'S POPULAR, SMALL AND THERE WILL BE A WAIT. SO DRINK UP!!!!\\n\\nFYI, It's behind Bally's to the east."}

Uses phrases like 'it's policy' and when I pointed out that the lowes at bell and grand (which I love) would have exchanged my item (this one was $15.98) Vivian folded her hands in front of her and said 'we follow policy here'!!!  It wasn't until I reacted to the word 'policy' - Vivian said that she's worked there for 8yrs. She said that she was going to call a mgr or someone to help do the refund  (which she only said after I asked for her name) Vivian also engaged with a frustrated customer and said that I kept cutting her off- I was done!  Done. I left a shopping cart of $260 sitting there because Vivian would not handle an exchange of $15.98."}

We decided to order a few starters and share, as it all looked so good!  The halloumi cheese was yum, the spinach\/feta pastry was ace and the humus was beautiful!  Mains was a mixed grill for each of us and I don't think I've ever eaten such soft and scrumpalicious rice! (And I've lived in Japan!)  It was a perfect complement to the meat, which was also lovely.  The staff were attentive and our meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food.  All in all, a cosy and intimate restaurant with tasty food.  Will most definitely go back when in Edinburgh."}

{"label":2,"text":"So, as a Plaza-Midwood resident, I had been anticipating the opening of our store with much excitement.  The futuristic meets Art Deco exterior is eye catching and draws one inside.  But, that is where the charm stops.  The interior looks like another big box store.  For its size, I am not noting an increase in selection compared to the old store.  The parking is terrible, but I do understand that they only have so much space available.  There is an upstairs which I have not seen, but have been led to believe that it is a dining area.  The staff appear to be radiant and welcoming for the most part.  Aside from one cashier, who carded me when I was buying wine and then said, \\\"just kidding,\\\" the workers have been polite and helpful.  However, I do believe that the new store s a boon to our neighborhood.  And hopefully with time, I will begin to make fond memories the way I did with the original HT."}

{"label":3,"text":"I was having severe abdominal pain for almost a week and even with a visit to urgent care, I couldn't figure out what was going on. A medical professional mentioned that it may be my gallbladder and prescribed me three medications that unfortunately didn't help! After having another attack, I took matters into my own hands and decided to research foods that naturally help your gallbladder and most importantly, avoid irritating it.\\n\\nI found that vegetable juices like beet, cucumber, tender baby greens, swiss chard, dandelion greens, beet greens, celery, carrots, ginger, and tumeric are great for gallbladder health as well as organic grape and apple juices. Other helpful foods to add to juices: lemon, avocado, vinegar, berries, papaya, pears, and flax and hemp seeds\/oils.\\n\\nTherefore, I was on a mission to find organic, cold-pressed juices that utilized these foods and hoped it would heal me! The store is very easy to find, in fact, I had seen it while driving by on Ft. Apache. Access and parking is simple as well. I love the interior! The adorable bee and honeycomb theme complete with adorable packaging, matching wall art, and the amazing table re-purposed from a tree!\\n\\nThe staff was so friendly, helpful, and insisted on samples. I told him which juices intrigued me and why, so I honed in on Bee WHealthy and Bee On Point. After sampling the two, I chose Bee On Point that is comprised of cucumber, celery, carrot, apple, kale, beet, dandelion, radish, lemon, ginger, turmeric, and pepper (16.9 fl. oz. for $10.99). Neither of the juices really tickled my fancy in the flavor department, however, that truly doesn't bother me nor will it stop me from future consumption because I need to minimize sugar (even natural sugar) intake as much as possible and that's typically what makes juices taste better.\\n\\nAnyway, the juice was great and filled me for three hours! That was enough time for me to finish what I needed to do for the day and get home for my next meal. The great news is that after just THREE days of eating and drinking the gallbladder-helpful foods, I was able to stop the attacks! It's really wonderful having access to a place like The Juice Standard to have truly healing products when you have health issues. It was honestly the only place I trusted to have something that wouldn't trigger another attack and I was very grateful for it. Your body will heal itself if you give it the right tools. \\n\\nFYI: You receive $1 off for each glass bottle returned! But the bottles are so nice, you might want to find a purpose for them at home. Also, keep in mind that these bottles are 99.9% juice which means you're getting the good stuff, not just water or miscellaneous fillers. Yay for cold-pressed!"}
{"label":2,"text":"The tortillas are very good, but the quality of the meat that they place therein is a bit of problem.  The first time I went I had the carne asado burrito, and although the taste was good, I chewed the meat in that thing for an hour and half and my jaw hurt. So the second time I went, I got the chicken burrito figuring the meat would be more tender. It was, but still the quality of the meat was lacking.  Again, the taste was decent. The third time I ordered a egg burrito for breakfast, and I must say that the quality of the eggs they put inside the burrito are just great.\\n\\nReally low prices and some nice baked goods.  I would certainly buy a bag of the tortillas they sell at the counter."}
{"label":4,"text":"Sapphires is my favorite strip club in Vegas...not that I'm a connoisseur of strip clubs or anything like that.  This place is huge and all there are so many dancers it makes your head spin.  Every type of woman a guy could want.  I'm not lesbian but I can totally appreciate a woman's beauty.  There are a lot of ridiculously hot dancers here with amazing bodies.  I'm a chick and chicks are usually really critical of other women and even I think they're hot.  I love the music here too.  There's a glass catwalk overhead and the girls dance above you.  There's lots of tables and space, so it's spacious.  The doormen are cool but maybe that's just because I'm a girl.  I've never been in the VIP room so I can't comment on that.  I love watching the girls do the crazy pole tricks too.  The drinks are good here too, not shiesty, like other clubs.  I don't know how but whenever we go here we roll in a limo or party bus, don't have to pay, and get drink tickets.  Someone I know, knows someone.  I don't know how the biz works, so sorry that I can't share that hook up.  Ask around if you plan on going here."}
{"label":2,"text":"Upon reading the reviews on this hotel, I was definitely expecting the worst. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It took my fiancee and I about 45 minutes to check in, which I felt was a little long. We stayed in Tower II, and our room was very nice and clean. The hotel definitely needs to upgrade the internet, bc they do not have wifi. But they did have internet connection (ethernet) in the room. The only issue inside the room that we encountered was that the breaker tripped or something, twice, shutting off the tv and internet both times. But surprisingly, both issues were fixed in less than 10 minutes.. I will not give this place 5 stars because of the CONSTANT HARASSMENT of people trying to sell you time shares. We were asked at least 30 times in a 5 day span. So irritating. But other than that, we enjoyed our stay at the Excalibur, and my first visit to vegas!"}
{"label":2,"text":"Went to dinner here on a Tuesday night. I'm gluten free (not by choice) and our server was really great about going through my options. He was also great about checking back with us and asking us how everything was without being too present. I think his name was Ryan? Definitely a great server. The seating is pretty awesome too, especially if you're on a date. They have semi-enclosed booths that are great for a more private dining experience. The food was pretty good. We got the NY strip and the Cioppino. For the price I expected the Cioppino to have a little more shellfish and not so many onions and peppers. The steak had great flavor and was cooked as ordered. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the bartender. I myself can be quite a loud talker but the restaurant was very quiet and she was talking to her two guests at the bar so loudly that it ruined the experience for us. The bar isn't far from the tables but the whole dinner we got to hear about her allergies and how she loves to drink and how she doesn't fit in with the people in Austin. I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and I completely understand connecting to and having a conversation with your guest. And to her credit she was friendly but her speaking voice was so ridiculously loud we could barely have our own conversation. We actually rushed through our meal just so we could get out of there! The last thing I want to hear about when I'm eating dinner is how sick you got the last time your allergies flared up. There's a fine line between outgoing and obnoxious. If we went back we'd be sure to sit further away from the bar. Overall decent food and good service."}

What it does offer though is fantastic views over the city and being a wide path, there is nothing to worry about.\\n\\nIt's a fairly steep climb, but as you go up and up you begin to realise the illogical nature of this path and begin to suspect whether Holyrood isn't just one of those great conspiracy theories (well surely it's all too good to be true).

I thought going in that this place would be worthy of a a 5 star review, but the lack of service killed the experience completely.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night around 7pm. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and given menus. Joel and I decided we would share our dishes since we wanted to try the same things. We waited probably 15 minutes and no one had come by. No drink order, nothing. The waiter and waitress continued to walk right by us and not even look at us. Finally when the waiter walked by I asked him if we could order. He said \\\" our waitress was really busy that's why she hadn't come by, but that he would take our order.\\\" I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice with an egg on top at a level 3. Joel ordered his favorite, Pad See Ew with pork at a level 2. The food took a lot longer then expected. I was hungry and wished we'd ordered an appetizer. I started noticing other tables that had come in after us getting their food. Weird. Finally out came our order! Mine was very tasty. It had chunks of short rib and the spice level was perfect. Next time I wouldn't spend the extra $1.50 for the egg on top. I was expecting it to be runny so I could mix it into the rice, but that egg was hard as a rock and did nothing for the dish. Joel's Pad See Ew was more broccoli then noodles, but still had a great flavor. \\n\\nThe decor is very minimum, but they do need to kick the heat lamps down a bit.

{"label":3,"text":"Ham samich.  They don't get much better than this.  I highly recommend trying one if you haven't.\\n\\nI quite enjoyed my Tavern sandwich.  Ham, bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a delicious honey mustard sauce were perfectly crafted between two slices of whole wheat bread.  I'd have to say this is one of the best deli style places I've been too, but keep in mind that I am not really a deli sandwich connoisseur.  I got the ham salad as a side, and I would have to say it was the right choice.  It was down right delicious.  Just do yourself a favor, and get this stuff with your sandwich.  Better yet, they have a ham salad sandwich (that I can't wait to try).\\n\\nThe service was friendly too.  The manager gave us four catering packages to give out to our business associates.  I am really hoping that my work orders some catering service from Honeybaked Ham.  They just kill that other deli that we have been ordering from for our staff meetings!"}
{"label":2,"text":"Less Douchy Than Expected.\\n\\nI went last night with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at the mix at Martini Ranch. I actually met some really nice people to hang out with (there were a lot of bachelorette parties there) and spent the evening in the club room upstairs with the go-go poles in it (note about the poles - they're on a platform and short so it's hard to do some of the pole tricks on them). \\n\\nThe DJ had some great dance music playing and everyone was dancing and having a great time without the pretentiousness you might find in other Scottsdale clubs.MR is good for a girls night out or a place to hang out with a group of friends.\\n\\nBeer's were cheap - $3.50 for a bottle there was plenty of space on the patio so you don't have to be pushed against some creepy guy the whole evening."}

The BF gets the Fried Oysters Appetizer its a HUGE portion and plenty on there that he cant even finish himself!! The only thing I would say negative was we went when it was 100 out and it was pretty warm in there but they cant help it with an open kitchen. Its a great place in a great area!"}
{"label":2,"text":"More accurately I'd give this restaurant 3.5 stars. I never thought I'd wish for fractions...\\n\\nThe service is great. I came here alone for my weekly antisocial mini-vacation and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Everyone I talked to was extremely helpful and welcoming. Ambiance is pleasant--a large window separates the restaurant from the rest of the casino so I didn't hear the slot machines. The lighting and circular setup turn it into a tranquil bubble within the casino. \\n\\nHere is the breakdown in ratings for different menu items:\\n\\nBREAD: 4 stars. They have a definite edge in the bread department because you get a little bowl of marinated garlic\/bruschetta...I have never seen such a wonder! That shiz is good as hell. The bread itself is pretty good, but the goody bowl is the impressive part!\\n\\nPASTA E FAGIOLI SOUP: 3.5 stars. Tasty lil bowl of soup. Nothing extravagant, but nice. \\n \\nCHICKEN ANGELO: 3.25 stars. I'm getting weird with fractions again. It's a good dish with a nice flavor and it was recommended by two of the staff members. Even though I liked it I couldn't help feeling there was something missing. I saved half the dish for later, which means it was good enough for me to take but it wasn't so good that I couldn't stop eating it. Maybe it didn't have MSG in it haha! That or it lacked an X-factor. \\n\\nTIRAMISU: 2 stars. I took this to-go and wasn't a fan. The ladyfingers were SOAKED in liqueur. They tasted gross to me. I avoided the soggy liqueur cake parts and just ate the creamy part which was just decent. I've had way better tiramisu. My waitress recommended this, which either means she loves liqueur and soggy cake or she just hasn't eaten as many tiramisus as me. It was a hot mess of a dessert. \\n\\nBecause I had such a pleasant time here, there is a chance I will return. Plus--I really like Southpoint and it's close to my house. It is overpriced though, so I'm more likely to try other places first. \\\"Luxury eating\\\" expenses aren't supposed to be in my budget, and I could have gone to Chipotle 4 times for what I paid (including wine and a hearty tip). No regrets, but can't justify rushing back either!"}

{"label":4,"text":"I drive over 20 miles one-way just for the roast beef!  You can't get quality roast beef from any store today, not even the high end grocery stores.  But you can always get it at Casella's, and at a very reasonable price.  Sure, stop by for lunch and get your hogie and meatball sandwiches, every sandwich is made with love and they are all great.  But before you leave, ask for some sliced roast beef and some provolone to go.  You will never buy roast beef from ANY grocery store again!  BTW, get some cannolis too.  They are the bomb!"}

The black cod was incredibly buttery. The spicy tuna appetizer was probably my favorite thing on the menu in the end.\\n\\nThe Okada roll was really good, especially if you have people who aren't into sushi in the group!\\n\\nThe alaskan crab was probably a bit disappointing. While it is really well plated, it is just not enough food."}

I might go back one more time if I look at the recent reviews and see some 5 stars comments. Otherwise it is all about David Wong's Pan Asian, Beijing Noodle Cafe, and Monta Ramen house which, in my opinion are in a league of their own (especially Pan Asian and Beijing Noodle Cafe)."}
{"label":3,"text":"I went to this place for lunch. It was a little crowded, but the service was still fast and friendly. Our food came out quickly, and it tasted very good. It actually had a medium amount of spice like we requested, unlike some places where even the mild is still uncomfortably spicy. Everything tasted very good, and was a reasonable price (we ordered from the lunch menu). I'll be going back."}

{"label":0,"text":"I could just put a sad face here, and leave it at that, but then you wouldn't know the excruciating time we had at this place. Wow. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and I don't give one star reviews lightly!! \\n\\nAfter hearing how great this place was over and over and over, and that it was on Diners, drive Ins and dives I HAD to go. I'm a sucker for that sorta thing, and man did this place miss the mark. I can honestly say unless they make some serious changes I may never go back or give it a second glance. \\n\\nParking was an adventure at this place.. the only spots open were close to a curb, so I decided to take my SUV and pretend it was a Jeep Wrangler. I got so frustrated trying to find a place to park on an empty stomach that I seriously just baja'd over the curb and bounced into the small spot that was waiting. \\n\\nWhen we came in, I was excited about this place. It had that old divey dinerish feel that I love and I figured there was NO way this place could be a miss. We got the menu and I thought everything sounded amazing! I ended up opting to make my own burger. Egg, mozzarella cheese & mayo. Pretty simple right? Well not for our server, she was apparently still drunk from her binge the night before. I know this because she told us, in her half arsed attempt of an apology. Sigh. I'll get there, don't you worry. \\n\\nI got my burger with fries. I'd asked for onion rings.... That wasn't that big of a deal, but it was only the beginning to the train wreck that was coming. The burger looked fantastic, and I couldn't wait to try it! Well I took that first bite and there was a taste I wasn't expecting... ONIONS. Really? So you forget the onion rings but you apparently added them to my burger, and went sans mayo. Good thing I like onions I guess. I just ate the burger and didn't say anything at first. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the BBQ sandwich with the sauce on the side and no coleslaw. She brings him the BBQ with no sauce, and coleslaw slathered on the top of it. He has to remind her that he asked for no coleslaw and the sauce on the side. She brings him two types of sauce to try and the sweeter of the two is a mustard based. How do I know this? Because she mixed the mustard in and a fat layer of yellow was on top the the smokey red. She didn't even mix it up or anything. Normally I'm not this picky of a person, but with every single thing that happened, I had enough. \\n\\nWe asked her for a box twice, and took home the leftovers. She did apologize about her screw ups, and said, \\\"I'm so sorry, I think I'm still half drunk. I'll give you a free dessert.\\\" I almost didn't get the dessert because by this point I had better things to do than spend any more of my time at the penguin. But she said banana pudding and I thought maybe that would bring them back up a star. She brought it over, I took a few bites and I just wasn't impressed. \\n\\nWhen we got home my stomach was all torn up, and I ended up throwing away the left overs. I didn't want to feel that way two days in a row. UGH. Sorry for the long winded review, but I warned you. \\n\\nMy take on this place: :( Save your money, and keep the experience of what you saw on TV in your heart. This place is sure to disappoint."}

After all, people are in their designer swimwear and are there to party, so there was never a shortage of entertaining displays of pick up lines and dancing. Wet Republic hosts such well known artists, like Tiesto and Calvin Harris, on certain days so it's awesome to enjoy their music and see them in person and in action!\\n\\nI must admit though, being spoiled is definitely the way to go here.

The guys who run it are pleasant, helpful and offer to find any products which they don't have in stock or recommend where you might find them.  \\nMy only criticism is that some of the things which they sell are a bit gimmicky and pointless.  For example, they were displaying an electronic rotating ice cream cone!  Does that appeal to anyone?  Possibly, but I can't help but feel that they'd benefit from specialising in stuff which people actually need.

It has limited selection but when it's that tasty, it really doesn't matter. They cook everything in small batches so the food is always fresh. They never skimp on any ingredients so you get lots of veggies and meat. The egg rolls - oh my.

Recently, the thermostat broke and needed to be replaced -- of course on a 107 degree Saturday.  We had the technician come out and he told us that they do not carry the part with them and that Accurate does not provide access to the part over the weekend.  He wanted to put on a temporary thermostat but made it clear that he had no idea if it would work.  Given the fact the 2-year old unit has broken twice already and we had no idea if it would void the warranty, we decided that was a bad idea.  We paid him $146 for this call.  \\n\\nWe then called another provider who stocks the part (yes, even on weekends and after hours) and we got it replaced a few hours later, no hassles.  I do not understand how an authorized service agent of Trane does not stock parts over the weekend, particularly when we are talking AC during June in Phoenix.  As an aside, Accurate did call 4 days later, but not to try to resolve our issue but instead to make sure their technician followed the protocol of the company, which I guess he did.  \\n\\nSo, I'd say if you want quick service and expert repair, steer clear of Accurate."}

{"label":4,"text":"Kick ass tacos, open late into the night, and cheap.  This place is doing it right!\\n\\nWe walked our way over here on our first night in Vegas, around 2 AM.  They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.\\n\\nThe Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order \\n\\nMy next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.\\n\\nYou have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!"}
{"label":2,"text":"Would you believe that this little independent wine bar has been tucked away in this location for something like 7 years? It's true! But they're so hidden and unadvertised that they go completely unremarked. \\n\\nThe space is very small and a bit awkwardly designed. There are three areas; the outdoor patio, the first sitting area by the bar, and the second area with couches and different sized tables. I came here on... another first date (this is getting exhausting) on a weekday and there was another couple in the space. They were sitting dead center of the second room which made it weird for us to sit there. The music was also so low that you could hear every word that was said. Awkwaaarrrddd...\\n\\nSo we sat on the couch in the front room, it's pretty comfy for sure. The menu is extensive, with a good variety of wines to choose from. You can go by the bottle or do different flights of three wines each. We went for the bottle, since it was half off that night. \\n\\nWe also ordered the cheese plate. You can choose three of your own cheeses, out of about  8 options. This thing is huge! With only two people, there was no hope of finishing it. Especially since I was being all lady-like and didnt want to stuff my face with cheese and olives like a fatty. \\n\\nPretty much right at 9:35, the waitress comes over and asks us if we're done. I hate that. Seriously. You close at 10. Don't advertise that you close that late if you don't want to. I asked her if we needed to close out and leave and with hesitancy she responded \\\"well... no\\\". Ok then. We'll stay until close!\\n\\nOverall, it was a pleasant enouch experience. The atmosphere is probably much better on the weekends when there are more people and they stay open later."}

It was a Thursday, mid-morning, and we were greeted right away by a woman who sat us. She was very nice. I ordered the \\\"homemade\\\" corn beef hash & eggs & I got the red velvet pancakes. The red velvet pancakes are divine. If you like red velvet, you'll love these. I've had lots of RV pancakes & these are by far the best. The corn beef has looked like a cube of dog food. I've had corn beef hash a lot & this wasn't that great, neither were the eggs which were a strange color. The hash browns were undercooked & bland. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet which also looked underwhelming & wasn't that great, according to him & he is an authentic Mexican. Haha. The portions were small & it was expensive. The reason I'm giving it 3 out of five stars is for their pancakes, which they're famous for, and our excellent service.

Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.\\n\\nI went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course.

It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full.

This restaurant is very pretty - beautiful lights and high ceilings - my kind of spot, except for the pretentious peeps. \\n\\nBeing a HUGE fan of the Chef Payton when he was at Digestif, I was so excited to try this place! As Camille mentioned, the mussels were so so yummy - I would come back again just to eat that dish. But the pulled mozzerella was a huge disappointment. I really hope the \\\"old school\\\" is up to par next time.\\n\\nYOU MUST TRY THE RED DELICIOUS COCKTAIL! It was so so so so good! This cocktail includes vodka, apple juice and apple foam with an apple slice for garnish. The foam tastes like caramel apples and the apple cocktail is like drinking freshly juiced apples - I've never had anything like this before!\\n\\nI really wanted to give this place a higher \\\"happy hour\\\" rating, but I cannot. The drinks were delish, but pretty expensive ($10 each). The pretentious peeps kind of ruined the mood for me (people who think they are out of this world make you wish they were!), and the pulled mozzarella did not live up to my expectations.\\n\\nAbout KIDS: This is NOT somewhere I would ever bring my five year old.

{"label":0,"text":"I finally got around to eating at L'Acad\\u00e9mie this Friday. The restaurant gives off this air of Zen grandeur and European opulence at the same time while serving a fusion of Italian and French fusion cuisine. What it is really is a lot of pretentiousness and posturing, form over function, appeal over taste.\\n\\nTo begin with I couldn't believe the menu or more to the point how 30 years ago it was. What self-respecting fine dining institution with any sense of modernity still serves Coquille St-Jacques, Escargot with garlic butter and Parmesan Fondue as entr\\u00e9e? Really? In 2008? Tortellini Cardinal is not fine dining it's now been reduced to cafeteria food. All good plates when well prepared, but preparations that are pass\\u00e9 and no longer original.\\n\\nI started with the Insalata Italiana or Italian Salad.\\nLovely greens, very fresh and some cherry tomatoes that tasted just awful and sticks of Parmesan Regiano with a nice Balsamic vinaigrette. Most restaurants drown their salads in vinaigrette, L'Acad\\u00e9mie seems to fear this very same thing by not putting enough dressing on the salad and the salad tasted dry.\\n\\nThen as my Primo Piatto, or Plat de Resistance\\nI went for the Filet Mignon with a Port reduction. I'm just a sucker for steak. It was served with potatoes that had been fried whole and some veggies. The only thing that was remotely good was the Port reduction. Ok maybe the corn cob which tasted a bit funny because it was obviously not from Qu\\u00e9bec soil.\\n\\nThe Broccoli bouquet was undercooked and completely tastless. The carrot was also seriously undercooked. There's a difference between Al Dente and undercooked; a chef should know such a simple difference.\\n\\nThe Potatoes... how can a chef screw up a staple like potatoes? We all eat potatoes, we can expect better than fried whole potatoes that have absolutely no seasoning or taste, are dry and crunchy; just so wrong.\\n\\nLast but no least on the hit list, the Filet Mignon. Now correct me if I'm wrong because I'm no steak expert but I eat enough steak in steakhouses and consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, but Filet Mignon shouldn't be marbled with fat and nerving right? Well I had to chainsaw this Filet Mignon and after three bites I was done.\\n\\nThat was it. Three bites of my steak and one half of a potato and I couldn't eat anymore. I was beyond disappointed. I knew I wasn't stepping into a high end restaurant, but it does hold up a promise of fine dining. This was ridiculous, flavourless and pretty much revolting.\\n\\nDesert... there was no desert;\\nI couldn't take any more disappointment this evening. Why is it restaurants or chefs can't prepare simple things like a steak? This is Montreal, a world renowned steak town and this supposedly fine dinning restaurant can't prepare a decent steak? When I try out new restaurants I go for the simple items on the menu, because that's the true test of a chef. If I go to an Italian restaurant and I order the ever classic and simple Alfredo and I can taste that it comes from a starch filled envelope, when it's quite possibly the easiest sauce to prepare, I will never set foot in that restaurant again; as I will do with L'Acad\\u00e9mie.\\n\\nA generous 1 outta 5."}

Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they \\\"only pull double shots\\\" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool.

They offer a delectable choice of sauces to complement the main entr\\u00e9e. The garlic was by far my favorite. Although, each sauce added a certain flair to every bite of steak. We ordered a regular size order of the skirt steak- the portions were more than plenty. A side of rice,  and a roasted corn completed our meal. Presentation was great. They used wooden oblong plates that added a certain element to the dish.\\n\\nOur order was brought out to our table surprisingly fast.  The skirt steak was tender, juicy and seasoned just right and served with a fresh baby greens salad and a slice of buttery toast. The roasted corn was tasty. The yellow saffron rice was good. The empanadas were okay. Overall,  the food was delectable and I will be back to try the rest of the menu offerings.

{"label":0,"text":"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\\n\\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \\\"large parties\\\" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\\n\\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."}

Well, I actually ate alone at the bar, which was the first time I have ever dined in a restaurant by myself, since my friend was in a meeting. I must say, eating by yourself, in a dress, ready to go out at night is one surefire way for guys (good and bad) to come talk to you. It was pretty empowering though, and when my friend showed up after her meeting to grab dessert with me, I think the bartenders believed me that I really wasn't a prostitute!\\n\\nI had the most amazing foie gras I've had in a while, a decent crab salad, and some fabulous duck. The albarino suggested by the bartender was ok, but the desserts were fabulous. I think we actually ordered two although I can't remember which ones since I was probably in a food coma by that point! Top off the meal with a drink from the bar and we were ready for a night out.\\n\\nIf you can, grab a seat overlooking the Lake of Dreams so you can watch the dancing frog.

{"label":2,"text":"Slanted Rice is a small more-or-less Vietnamese restaurant located in the Hilton Village outdoor mall, near its north end.  It has all of the ingredients it needs to be a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene, except for what I call \\\"food design\\\".\\n\\nFor example, the Drunken Beef - basically filet mignon cubes with fried onions - had a big problem: the beef was tough and chewy, probably because they used the filet mignon tips, or possibly because the meat was not filet mignon at all.  The crispy rice bowl with chicken was a smallish bowl of cripsy rice, but it came with such a scarcity of chicken and vegetables that it wasn't much beyond the rice.  The chicken that was there was dried out.\\n\\nThere were other issues with the food as well.  The free broth served with the meal was bland except for a strange almost cinnamon taste.  The egg rolls were small and the filling was mushy.\\n\\nAlthough prices at Slanted Rice are not high (our entrees were $16 and $20), the portions are small and the value is barely there.  On the other hand, service was good, the menu was interesting, and the ambiance was inviting, but that was not enough to make up for the food, which was passable at best."}

It's a good compromise between American-Chinese takeout and some more authentic flavors (e.g., a fish steamed in its entirety, head and all).  \\n\\nThe quality\/quantity to price ratio is not super. For example, the \\\"fried duck with taro stuff\\\" [sic] came with more taro \\\"stuff\\\" than duck. The pieces are served atop a big mound of shredded cabbage to make the plate seem more plentiful than it actually was.  The taste is good, but I'm not sure if it's $15 good. The fried tofu and scallop balls had more tofu than scallops, and the scallops were not of the best quality.  The whole fish, though I like it, is too expensive for what it is ($24 for flounder; $30 for sea bass). \\n\\nThe service is prompt and, in its own way, friendly. There is no ambiance to speak of, though that's not what people come here for. I have some reservations about the cleanliness of the kitchen (it has the look of LA restaurants that get B or C on their hygiene grade cards[*]), but I'm not so worried as to not eat here.\\n\\nSummary: Comparing \\\"OK\\\" with other nearby Chinese restaurants, I think I prefer Rose Tea and Ka Mei a smidgen more.\\n\\n[*] http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Restaurant_rating#Sanitation."}

Now I know I need to never come back here again. \\n\\nThis place is just one big NO. I have no idea how it has become so popular. I really do not get it. I got the pastrami and cheese. This was the sandwich: a slice of regular white bread, three slices of tomatoes, two tablespoons of bland cole slaw, 2 pounds of french fries, one tiny little slice of cheese, about 3-4 slices of pastrami, and another slice of regular white bread. As you can tell from my description, there was not enough meat, non-existent cheese, and way too many fries. The only thing on my sandwich with any flavor was the pastrami (that was actually pretty good and what earned this place a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star). But there just wasn't enough pastrami and the signature fries and cole slaw were not very good. \\n\\nMy sister ordered the cheesesteak, which is really just a cheeseburger. We also ordered the Smallman St. Fries, which are fries with cheese, bacon, chili, and sour cream. They sound delicious right? They looked delicious too. I was super excited to eat them. Sadly, like my sandwich, they did not live up to the hype.

Not being one to completely write off a place due to one bad experience, I called again to make an appointment (with a different nail tech) for the day of, which was booked, so I made an appointment for the following day.  Not long after, I received a call from the salon stating a time had opened up with Barbara if I still wanted it, which I accepted.  Barbara is such a nice person in general to sit and chat with, but she does an amazing job as well!  I was in and out of the salon on my lunch break from work, and because of my previous experience, she didn't charge for the service.

This was a nice piece of 8 ounce lobster pan fried in bread crumbs, no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no basil, nothing (at least you can't taste any seasoning). They serve it with warm drawn butter and a horrible orange colored sauce. When you think Chicken Fried you think of big flavor and this missed the mark.

{"label":1,"text":"I would love to give the hummus here 5 stars it's really that good! \\n\\nHowever the 2 times I've gone though really deserves 2 stars. I would give the food 4 stars. The service though is slacking big time!!!! \\n\\nThe first time I went the server was very awkward and talked wayyy too much. Even went on to say something about not ordering the flatbread because it has \\\"way too many carbs\\\" under his breath. Hello I'm a normal 20 something girl, yes I like to watch my figure, but I freaking love carbs! Thank you! Ha! It also took 15 minutes to get both of my friends cocktails! This isn't even an exaggeration because a lot of the food we ordered was out by the time they got them. \\n\\nAs for my exact same cocktail that I ordered somehow got lost in translation. this place had barely anyone in it, I believe this was just the servers mistake at this point (no worries because everyone makes mistakes). \\n\\nWhat takes the cake though is he tried arguing with me how I never order one when all I did was ask politely where my cocktail was. Okay, so you didn't think I ordered one, but clearly I did, don't argue, just say sorry and go and reorder or order the cocktail I requested. \\n\\nThere were a few other incidents with this server, I forget his name, but did not really set the tone for finer dining. \\n\\nAfter that time I wanted to go back with my boyfriend because venues really do deserve a second chances. (Even third! Sometimes.) The second time was much much busier, after waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time we were sat at a small two top table in the front of the restaurant, wasn't exactly what we pictured, but weren't going to be picky because we just wanted a romantic night! \\n\\nSome commotion started happening with the tables next to us, they looked as though they were setting up for a big party. Then a someone came to inform us that a huge bachelorette party was being seated next to us and wanted to know if we would like to move. \\n\\nWe agreed that this was probably best, so we were moved to the chefs counter until another table was available. As the food we ordered at our old table started coming out to the new spot, everything seemed awkward at this point, and definitely a mood killer! We just wanted to be at an actual table eating and drinking the food we ordered!\\n\\nWe were finally sat our [final] table and they told us they were moving our food, which they did; but somehow took a bit, and by that time most of it was cold. We were very polite the whole time, but the night just wasn't going as we'd hoped. \\n\\nAfter the shuffle around the restaurant by multiple servers\/ managers\/ and hosts. We got the bill and (not saying that they have to) but not even a cocktail was taken care of for the inconvenience. Not that it was expected, but honestly it would have smoothed the experience over  for something as crazy as being moved 3 times in the middle of dinner.  \\n\\nIt was my boyfriends first time, and needless to say he isn't as forgiving as I am, and probably will not be back."}

And unlike for some of the guests in this place, for me \\\"working\\\" is not a euphemism for prostitution.\\n\\nMy room was small and bizarrely laid out, which made it difficult to relax in, especially when I had a guest. I can't imagine staying here with another person., or really trying to get work done in the room. There was also an unpleasant smell- like some kind of perfume. I kept looking for an air freshener or some other source of the odor, but didn't see one.\\n\\nOne day my shower handle broke while I was taking a shower and I wasn't able to turn off the water. Since they had no maintenance staff on site at the time, I had to change rooms- but not before the desk clerk asked some random male guest to come into my room to try to fix the shower. He brought his beer and chips in with him.\\n\\nIt was a huge pain to move after living there for several weeks, and the room they  moved me to had a screwed up lock. So sometimes I couldn't get into my room.\\n\\nThere was a mysterious, disgusting substance on my door handle the entire time I stayed there, and the treadmill was broken the entire time as well. Remember, I was there for a month.\\n\\nThey allow animals, and for a while there was a dog in a room by the elevator that would bark at me while I waited for the elevator.\\n\\nThey clean the rooms once a week, but they missed my cleaning day one week and I had to remind them.\\n\\nOne the plus side, it's a short walk to a Starbucks, a grocery store, and other stuff, and the strip isn't too far away.

The platter also consists of a nice portion of vegtables (carrots, squash, carrots), potatos and rice. You also get a few pieces of pita.\\n\\nThe hummus platter as an appetizer is excellent. There are 3 different types of hummus (regular, sun dried tomato and another kind that I can't recall).

And yes, the donuts were good. \\n\\nIts tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\\n\\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\\n\\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM\/ Banks on Boulder Hwy.\\n\\nFriendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops.

There wasnt too much sauce which was nice, i hate having things smothered in sauce and making the bun soggy. The Brisket was okay, good flavor but could have been more tender. The burger itself was cooked well done. I prefer my burgers with some pink. I guess i should have indicated that online in the comment section while ordering. Overall the burger was just okay.\\n\\nI also ordered a cup of chiken tortilla soup as a side. This was very good! packed with flavor, had a little kick. It was filled with shredded chicken and corn it was very good! I liked it better than the burger. \\n\\nOver all meal was good. I would come back and try other items."}

Here sat a beautiful and what seemed tp be cursed wine bar that switched its course and ended up a burger joint. \\n\\nI can still confirm that it's a beautiful restaurant. Dark wood, dimly lit with a romantic vibe. It still yearns to be a wine bar. By the look of the massive amounts of wine behind the bar, it seemed as if it was. 'Tis not the real sitch though. With only about 10 choices between red and white and far more beer options, you'd be best to put the wine bar days behind you. I was still happy to see my glorious Malbec on \\\"tap.\\\" I was def not feeling the $10 for an 8oz pour, so me and my friend opted for the whole bottle for $30 to split. I was feeling a little buzz!\\n\\nI had perused the menu beforehand and was very excited about the prospect of truffled mustard and pretzels calling my name! But when it was set down there was a bit of shock. I expected truffled mustard to go with a handmade mini pretzels. It was not. It was store bought pretzels you get from Giant Eagle. Thatt's okay, the delicious mustard more than made up for it considering I wanted to swim in a pool of it. Ahmahzing!\\n\\nSo, of course I had to ask for a side of it to accompany my portobello and Swiss cheese burger. I thought the burger itself was tasty. It tasted smokey, which I enjoy. The meat wasn't as fresh as my fave, Wingharts, but it was good. I also was glad to have two portobellos stacked on top. I think sometimes places are chincy with my bellos! But that mustard... Gawd! It just put it over the top. Oh yeah, there was also coleslaw. It was pretty forgettable.\\n\\nThe one thing to note is that they serve everything in red checkered ballpark style cartons. \\nIt doesn't bother me. I'd have eaten it off the floor if it's promised to be a good meal (with that mustard!!) no problem! It just didn't match the aesthetic. I don't expect fine china either. Maybe just some funky dishes. Am I being nitpicky? Probably. Just an observation.\\n\\nWould I go back? Absolutely! Would it maybe be just for the promise of that mustard? Probably considering I was about to put the leftovers into my purse..."}

We waited a long long time until they finally took our order and waited over 40 minutes until our food was finally cooked. It was an insane amount of time. This was on a Tuesday night! It wasn't even a weekend but I guess they were still busy. But I still personally feel waiting nearly an hour is just absurd and retarded. They did take one of our meals off because we complained but it was just the $8 soup taken out. They should have given us 50% off the whole bill since we waited so very long.\\n\\nSo next time you come here. Share the pizza and enjoy it! It's delicious and I might come back just for that but as long as you know the service can possibly suck, just either accept it or don't come here at all."}

The portions were enormous, even the appetizers which makes it great to share with a small group...the atmosphere was a lot cooler than i expected being from out of town. The artwork on the walls really caught my eye and gave me a lot to look at-which made the time fly while waiting on our order, which was perfect timing.. didn't take long at all. The pricing was great, and the selections on the menu made it so hard to decide what to get, but everyone one was extremely satisfied with their meals. Wait staff was quick and friendly. Wish we had one of these at home - definitely leaves you full, and not guilty since you are eating pretty healthy here."}

{"label":1,"text":"On my most recent trip to the Cosmopolitan (which was for a work conference) I had a free night for dinner and was totally on my own so I decided to grab some pizza and a beer for dinner. After a little wandering around I managed to find Secret Pizza's location. It was somewhat of a let down because I didn't really care for their pizza or beer selection. I guess I am not hipster enough for cheap beer in plastic cup. I don't remember exactly what the choices were but it was the mass produced watered down stuff like Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. The pizza itself was pretty greasy and tasted like most (if not all) of the ingredients had come out of a jar or can. Don't get me wrong, it probably would hit the spot after a night clubbing but for a dinner after a long work day it was a big disappointment. On top of that there is not much seating and there were some very loud children playing with the arcade games that are in there. I ended up taking my pizza and plastic cup back to my room and leaving half a slice in the mini fridge when I checked out the next day."}
{"label":3,"text":"Now I had a good excuse to go to the mall. I need to go for early voting! \\n \\nThis polling place is located inside the mall on the first level out in front of Kohls. It doesn't matter what precinct you're assigned to, any registered voter can vote here during early vote week. The lines were long but there were plenty of election monitors and the polling place here was well staffed and organized. So it was a relatively a short wait in line.\\n\\nEveryone that I encountered was pleasant and professional. As I got to the front of the line a polling assistant lead me to one of the election clerks sitting at the tables. Since I took the address label from my voter ballot with me, all they had to do was scan the barcode.  You don't have to bring your sample ballot but it does make the process move faster.  Verification is determined by the signature match on file, birthdate and address. Election clerk did not ask for any ID.  After signature verification, I was handed a plastic card and led to the polling area. From there the poll worker let me know which election monitor is available.\\n  \\nThe election monitors are touch screen and are activated once you insert the card inside the machine. Think ATM machine...that's how these monitors operate.  These screens were super sensitive I noticed.  Just a slight touch of the screen was all it took.  I followed the easy to read prompts on the monitor, made my choices, watched my ballot get printed and made sure it was all correct then casted my vote. Voila!!  It took about 3 minutes total. Your card ejects and as you exit just hand it to the poll worker collecting it.  Another poll worker handed me my \\\"I Voted!\\\" sticker. That's it! Whole process was real easy."}

{"label":0,"text":"The service here is the worst- the employees don't care about customer service at all.\\n\\nI think this place only hires high school and young college age employees.  I went in to order a cake for my husbands birthday two days before, and the kid that helped me (if you can call it help) acted like I was bothering him just by being there. I had never ordered a cake through Baskin Robbins before and every time I asked  a question he looked at me like I was an idiot.   I finally got the order done and paid for (He never asked for my name or contact info for the order either) and went on my merry way. We had a change of plans for our get together and I needed to get the cake a day sooner, so I called to see if they could accommodate. After much back and forth I was told that the cake would be ready by 6pm and that they would call me when it arrived so I could pick it up. By 630 I hadn't recieved a call, so a friend and I went to pick it up. The 3 teenaged girls working had NO idea what was going on, and talked to me like I was stupid for coming a day early for the cake. Turns out that the cake decorator was unable to finish the cake, but the store failed to call to inform me. I told them I would be in the next morning to get the cake. The next day my husband and I went in to get the cake and I was informed that they had CANCELLED THE CAKE. So not only did my guests not have cake to enjoy, but my poor husband did not get a cake for his birthday all because some dumb kids couldn't get things right.  The \\\"manager\\\" (who was busy flirting with a customer when we arrived, and seemed annoyed that she had to help a customer instead) did nothing to fix the issue so I had to submit a complaint to corporate. \\n\\nTerrible service. and the store was filthy every time I was there.  The owner clearly has no idea how poorly the store is being run. If they did they would probably fire the lot of them.\\n\\nBottom line? go somewhere else.\\n\\n**UPDATE**\\n    When I called to file a complaint with the corporate office, I was told the franchise owner would contact me within 4 business days. It has been more than two weeks with no contact. This leads me to believe that the problem here stems from poor franchise ownership and has trickled down. Clearly customer satisfaction is not a goal for this owner."}
{"label":2,"text":"Went here last night for dinner around 8pm. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated promptly. There was a pizza and wine special (every Weds apparently), but we opted to go order from the menu as i had pizza for lunch.  I love trying chicken salad sandwiches at new places, so why should this place be any different? Maizie's had grapes and dried apricots mixed in... Wonderful! Perfectly peppery to balance out the fruit.  For the side, the server recommended a mix of hand-cut and sweet potato fries, which did not disappoint.  I love SP fries that are medium cut like theirs and the fresh-cut potatoes were amazing! The chipotle aioli was quite good too.  I wasn't in the mood for a drink (what?!), but i did try the bf's red sangria, which was pretty good and i would definitely order it next time i want a cocktail.  He ordered the special which was ribs with sides of new potatoes, roasted veggies and some sort of corn. He couldn't finish it all and that is quite odd for him. At $13 it was quite the steal for him to have leftovers!\\nI hope we can get back there for happy hour, which runs from 3-6pm... I can't remember if its weekdays or every day...

This time, I decided to give this one a try, expecting a similar experience, but here's some of what I found up here:\\n\\n*  It's quite similar inside to the Thomas Road location, but the dining area isn't furnished as well.\\n\\n*  Went for soup first, as usual, but there were no soup spoons out, or available.  (Have I eaten at 100 other buffets here in the Valley without ever having run into this?)  An employee told me they let themselves run completely out of them to save money.  (I thought to myself, \\\"They could save even MORE money by closing this location... and maybe they should!)\\n\\n*  Went for a chicken wing, which is what I eat!  The only way you could get one here, was firmly attached to more of the chicken!  The whole thing was heavily breaded & cooked with the skin on, so there was no hope of pulling it apart at the serving tray.  It was either take it the way you don't want it, or don't have it at all.  Please someone, teach the preps here how to cut up a chicken!!  (Was I 8, or 9, when I learned how to do it?)  That's enough of an example of how the whole visit went here.  You get the idea.\\n\\nOverall, the food was about the same as Thomas (good), but the serving area setup here is also not as attractive or convenient as the one on Thomas, so for me the place plummeted all the way down to 3-Stars from the 5 I had expected it to earn.\\n\\nOn the way home, I sang \\\"Could've Been\\\" by Tiffany."}

It was like 40 a person for dinner. And we were prepared to pay.\\n\\nThe food was disgusting. We went on a Saturday night so it should have been busy enough for the food to rotate though. Everything I ate was dry and nasty. Like when you leave meat out for a few hours and the top of it crusts over. Or noodles that are half mushy half dried out hard. And the meats at the carving station was extra, extreme rare, borderline raw. \\n\\nI really thought there would be more selections. But in all seriousness, it's not at all bigger than your average neighborhood asian buffet. Except it's stretched out in a long line instead of cramped together. Because asian buffets do have american food and pasta and pizza. It's nasty, but it's the same nastiness of this buffet.\\n\\nI thought the plates were beautiful. But I don't want to pay 40 dollars to eat on a nice plate.\\n\\nOn the upside, we recieved very good service.They were quick, and continually took our plates and refilled our drinks. We were however RIGHT next to their waiting station though. lol. The wait in line was pretty fast too. We probably waited less then 15 minutes. (On a busy night at HomeTown Buffet, (in the ghetto btw ;P  ) the wait time can be a freaking hour). \\n\\nAlthough our table wasn't that far, most of them were like a maze. I think I would definitely have gotten lost. However, like only a few feet from our table was a giant pile of dirty dishes, near the employee entrance. If I hadn't have been so obsessed with the disappointment of the food, I would have noticed that while I was there. Oh, but we have plenty of pictures with a huge stack of dirty dishes in the background.\\n\\nI have to add that the line for crab legs is ridiculously long. It's a good 20 minutes in the line, but what makes it ridiculous is that the crab legs aren't worth it a bit. I got a plate full of it and ended up not eating any of them. I can't put my finger on it. It's too salty, but that's not the problem. I can' only relate it to having a metallic taste of it. I don't know what it is.

The venue has ticketed shows playing at 8pm, 10pm and 12pm. After these shows are over walls will open up and the room turns into a dance club with a DJ. This is probably when you start drinking and taking down shots. \\n\\nI can't remember the last time that I was out past midnight just because I wanted to be. I arrived in time to make most of the last show and try some of their food menu. The show was entertaining but very strange, definitely memorable. I would go into details but I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. As for the food, I tried the rabbit fricassee, steak frites, and bone marrow. They were all pretty good but pricey for tapas, but that should be expected when dining in the Cosmo. \\n\\nI chose to not start drinking until after the show because I wanted to see the venue sober...( my tolerance is ridiculously bad). We luckily got a tour of the place and was able to see every room.\\nTIP: If you see a door and it doesn't look like a kitchen or staff service well, go through it. It probably leads to another room. \\n\\nMy favorite room by far has to the speakeasy\/study in the back which is small and intimate but lively. They have a couple shelves of old school classic records that you can pick through and play on their record player which is fun. My friends had a great time going through them, reminiscing the good old days when they were ...well my age.\\nThere is an exit door into the casino from this room which makes leaving the maze stress-free. \\n\\nWARNING: Their drinks hit hard. \\nExpect their signature cocktails to blow your mind. These drinks were delicious! Probably some of the best cocktails I've ever had. \\nThey serve their signature cocktails in martini glasses but most of their drinks are served in heavy spinning cups with a single large block of ice. Pretty neat and very fun especially when you're intoxicated...that or I'm just easily amused. \\n\\nI recommend everyone to come experience Rose.Rabbit.Lie.

Huge bummer.\\n\\nThe burrito was all kinds of delicious (and the portion is perfect, unlike the 'roided up burritos found at Qdoba, Chipotle and even Chico's) but sitting at a rock hard, scorching hot picnic table took a bit of the enjoyment away from the experience. \\n\\nI understand the converted house is tiny (and that's part of charm), but would investing in some misters downgrade the authenticity? I think not. \\n\\nAlso, I'm not against any Green initiatives, but delivering food baskets sans napkins is a bad move.\\n\\nI'll definitely go back for the carne, but probably not anytime before late October."}
{"label":1,"text":"Dropped in with a friend on a Friday night and it was D-E-A-D.....that's never a good sign but we figured oh well, we're here so might as well stay.  We grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order.  My friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight, it was about 12:08.  That was annoying because I just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the WHOLE thing open until 2:00am.  So once that was discovered we decided we were just gonna finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food.  Unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished.  We were looking around the whole bar (which again, was 90% empty) and couldn't find her anywhere.  After a while I finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her.  The whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that, while friendly, wasn't present when we needed it."}

It almost felt as if it was the first time he was cutting hair professionally (shakey and slow). \\n\\nHere's the kicker, I go to pay and asked what the original cost was (because I always tip on the original amount of the service) and the receptionist tells me its $35. The groupon I purchased was $30 (supposed to be a $70 value). I was shocked. I saved a total of $5 by purchasing the groupon. \\n\\nBottom line, they clearly reserve their higher level stylists for non-groupon clients. The whole point of the groupon is to try out a new salon and hopefully become a regular client. I suggest the folks at Folicle remember that moving forward."}

The food is really nothing special\\n3. I guess a pro to all the chaos is that it's cheap (although we managed to spend over $100 for 3 people......but in theory it's *supposed* to be cheap)\\n4.

It has a great view and its surprisingly quiet and secluded while being right above Indian School road. The wine and beer selection is impressive. I really like all of the local choices. \\nThe food however was underwhelming. I started with the fries which had rosemary and parmesan and a dipping sauce similar to a thousand island on the side. It was good, but not great. For our entrees we had the sausage and mushroom pizza, and the penne ragu. The pizza was tasty, it had caramelized onions three types of mushrooms and Italian sausage, the crust was just the way I like it not too crispy and not too soft, but definitely a fork and knife needed pizza. The ragu was interesting; it reminded me of everything that would be inside a shredded beef burrito but instead of a tortilla it's in a bowl with penne pasta underneath. It wasn't bad just unexpected. I wish we would have tried desert they all looked delicious, perhaps next time. \\nAll in all I think this is a great place for appetizers and drinks especially on their wonderful patio."}

{"label":1,"text":"My Dad won a slot jackpot here twenty years ago so this place has a lot of nostalgic value for us.. We booked six rooms for my siblings, nephews, etc., to the tune of about $1400.00. \\n\\nWhen you book you think you're getting a four star hotel, then guess what? When you get there the fee you paid was for the old, Carson Tower.. (our room has crumbling popcorn ceilings (asbestos? I hope not) and without even a desk or fridge.. Decidedly two star. ) If you want the better four-star room, you have to pay an additional $19\/ night. The old Bait and Switch.. very frustrating.. Good beds, though!\\n\\nIn our bathroom alone, the sink was cracked almost in half, the door levers are tarnished, toilet old and broken (a real chug-a-lug) and towels stained brown and threadbare. Unbelievable. When I called Roxanne, she was sorry about the sink but staunchly defended the hotel's four-star rating, saying three times it was rated by AAA, etc.. I guess a customer in a room's opinion doesn't matter.\\n\\nHousekeeping: 5 pm and when we got back to our room. no housekeeping service had been done, wet towels were still on floor.. I called Sharon in housekeeping and she had no reason for this and said she thought we had checked out. No, we're here two more days!! Then early one morning they're pounding at out door at the strike of 9 am. Isn't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in? Then they left no coffee cups.. The Keurig coffee cartridges cost $2.50 each (39 cents at Costco) so bring your own.\\n\\nPOOL: In the morning my friend and I wanted to sit at the pool and have a drink before exploring.. At 9:25 a.m. there was only about 30 people at the pool, but guess what? People have reserved for themselves every single chaise lounge (Approx. 200 or so of them)  by putting a book, hat, or towel from their room on them.. What about the morning guests? I found out later that they do this so they can try to sell day beds by the upper pool for $200 each. (You can stay three nights at the hotel for that amount!) Well it's a busy Sunday and they've only rented one (out of about twelve!) leaving lots of these huge beds wide open, while just one level below, dozens of people stand around chaise-less.. It's very sad, indeed..At 5 pm they let everyone and anyone into the pool area.. four gang members (and a baby) entered, who said they were from NW Vegas and took the four chaises next to us.. pants sagging low, throwing gang signs, we got a little nervous and left..\\n\\nWIFI:  the wifi in your room costs $12.99 per room\/ per day\/ PER DEVICE!! I am a normal, connected person with an iphone, ipad, macbook.. Those three devices (and my roommate's two) would have cost us $64.95 a day just for wifi! Does this seem fair?? (Roxanne the manager did help me out a bit on this issue, thanks so much!)\\n\\nIn the parking garage, the closest, premium parking spots are all empty and reserved for the managers, directors, etc.. making the paying customers park up a few levels. This is so they don't  have to use the garage elevators, one broken, the other slow and on it's last leg..We waited six minutes for the elevator (there's only six levels!!) It's not even check out time..\\n\\nBUFFET: The entrees, although salty, are actually quite tasty. But the desserts, which look great, are awful. The apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste. Everyone at my table was spitting out their desserts, not a pretty picture. If you have a larger group, there is a forced 18% gratuity that you have to pay in advance. I like to tip from my heart at the end of the meal.. those buffet workers really deserve it, though!\\nFOOD: The Carson St. Cafe is decent, good breakfast.. great bread! My over-medium eggs had the white still raw, but the nice waiter replaced them along with some really nice fruit. Avoid the Asian Cuisine restaurant, my cashew chicken was something like $16.95 and was bland, tasted straight out of the Chun King can..\\n\\nThere are many nice employees here, but I was disappointed with our stay.."}

I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.\\n\\nI had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.

I don't know if this is a result of diminishing returns or because this is true. Either way, food was still good, service was excellent, and alcohol is extensive as far as choices.

The variety of mushrooms were especially flavorful and distinct.  For dessert, we ordered three flavors of gelati $9; Colorado River Coffee Roasters espresso, pistachio, and dark chocolate malt.  The gelato was soft, rich and flavorful, with the pistachio and dark chocolate malt my favorites.  \\n\\nOverall:\\nA great dining experience if you are looking for a relaxing meal in a beautiful environment.

As a big time EDM fan, I heard some Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Porter Robinson. Good stuff. Great music going on upstairs. \\n\\nUpstairs was awesome, but just way too cramped. Another thing that sucked was that there was a crap ton of dudes dancing up there. They should have taken a queue from the Monarch next door and let ladies in for free.  They ought to have the EDM DJ downstairs, and put the hip hop DJ out of a job, because no one was dancing to his mix. I mean, I tried to give him a chance, but he was playing THE WORST hip hop.Stuff you have never heard that is not dance worthy.

{"label":2,"text":"For years, when going to the theater, my friend and I have eaten across the street at Indian Spices, or occasionally next door at Christo's, looking out one window and into the window of Lemon Grass.  They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\\n\\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\\n\\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\\n\\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\\n\\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\\n\\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\\n\\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\\n\\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\\n\\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\\n\\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\\n\\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\\n\\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\\n\\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\\n\\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\\n\\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\\n\\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\\n\\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck."}

{"label":0,"text":"By far the WORST wash I have ever received anywhere, and this was a $70.00 service.  I still have stains on my passenger side carpet (which was the reason for getting the shampooing in the first place).  I don't think that they even washed it as they were supposed to.  I had to tell them for 20 minutes major areas that they had missed.   I need to clean all of  the windows myself since they are dirty still and have water spots and fingerprints on them.  The guy I arranged everything with was nice and assured me everything would be perfect.  I told him if I was going to pay so much I was going to be very picky.  He understood and guaranteed it would be perfect.  However, he was not the one doing the work.   I would be upset if I had only paid $12.00, because there are plenty of places that do a much more thorough cleaning for that.  But having paid far more, I feel the need to alert my fellow yelpers to this scam of a car wash.  My car reeks of mildew and the wet seat with whatever they used to clean stained my shorts a yellowy brown color.  Thank God I didn't have somewhere to be after the car wash.

But, if you are a sweet-lover like myself, here are my top picks: raspberry, grape, blueberry, amber, catawba, honeysuckle, and the delightful 'Santa' (cinnamon apple). The only caveat of Arsenal is that the ABV is higher than most, and this stuff goes down sooo smooth... It's way too easy to drink an entire growler all by yourself!\\n\\nOh, one more warning that will hopefully prevent others from doing what I did: After you've finished your growler, you will undoubtedly want more. Wash it out, let it dry upside down in a dish rack, then put the lid back on it, and close it. I didn't close the lid once, and my bf just took the bottle back to Arsenal and got it refilled. I came home, took a swig right outta the growler, and it tasted a little.. off. Then, he poured it into a cup, and guess what? I'd just drank a bunch of fruit flies. Are you gagging?

{"label":4,"text":"I would give this additional stars if I had the option.\\n\\nMy husband and visited Pittsburgh for our anniversary 8\/2\/2014 and based on reviews we decided to have our special dinner at the restaurant Root 174. We couldn't decide from the tempting and unusual choices so we ordered the Tasting Menu with 6 courses, priced at $67\/person. The waitress (she was superb; attentive, friendly, helpful and informative) cautioned us that we should not order this if we're at all picky or have allergies\/aversions. We are foodies. We wanted the chef to enjoy himself and pull out all the stops, and we happily gave ourselves over to being surprised. This turned into a very generous assortment. I was expecting like one tiny bite of everything; not so. \\n\\nEach course was delicious, and all different. I will not itemize each one here as there were so many and I honestly can't rate one over another, they were all that good. One conclusion we agree upon is that like a musical composition made up of component parts, each of these creations blended seemingly disparate ingredients in a completely harmonious way. Yet each part retained its own identity; you could really enjoy the ripeness of the fig appetizer whose sweetness contrasted by the creamy bleu cheese; the sharply vinegar white anchovies against the creamy-custard poached egg in the caesar salad; the perfectly tender mild octopus with the vibrant and spicy romesco...well, you get the idea. This is a tiny restaurant (seats only maybe 40), and nearly invisible to the passer-by. In fact, it was raining hard and we walked right by the entrance and missed it on the first pass; I guess we were trying to avoid puddles. \\n\\nYou gotta look for it. And it's SO worth the effort!! We both agreed that this is probably the most memorable dinner we've ever had, and we have visited many wonderful places. Keith Fuller is an artist, and this restaurant is a gem. We look forward to our next visit."}

The music is like the soundtrack to a good action flick. The rock-a-Billy staff offers great service with a smile without being formal. The menu is far from clich\\u00e9. You'll find items here found nowhere else in Montreal. The drinks... lots and lots of singular drinks, making this one hell of an interesting bar... seriously I could spent my pay on drinks there. Plus I love drinking out of a mason jar. I know I have no class.\\n\\nT H E   B A D\\nOr \\\"T h e   n o t   s o   g o o d\\\". Normally I reserve my good-bad-ugly review for disaster restaurant experiences. This wasn't a disaster but it was a very divisive experience. They have some very UNIQUE menu items, one of which is the Louis Cypher - the Angel Heart reference alone made sure I was getting this - is a homemade CORNDOG - been waiting for this for years - made of sausage with cheese dredged with a thick tasty batter. How is this bad you ask? Deep fried battered sausage, that's the dream man. Unfortunately, there was so much batter on the sucker that the batter wasn't cooked through and the sausage at best was bordering on cold. I was utterly disappointed since my anticipation was sky-high. There was also cornbread, dry and crumbly, still tasty, but no punch to it.\\n\\n\\nT H E   U G L Y\\nDiablos BBQ offers the ultimate southern steak, the Chicken Fried Steak. It's like fried chicken but with a slab of cow. It's battered and dredged and deep fried as is it were chicken and slathered with a peppered white sauce (aka b\\u00e9chamel) and comes from the German settlers who transformed their Wiener Schnitzel to adapt to what was available in cattle country. It's so awesome it's even served for breakfast with eggs down south. Mind-blowing stuff - which I make a pretty good version of at home. Unfortunately the batter seemed to be made of pepper only and I couldn't take more than my first bite. Fortunately the manager agreed with me and there was discussion of the prep cook and a wood chipper, but I digress. Of course I couldn't get the fried chicken, same dredge. \\n\\nT H E   V E R D I C T\\nAgain I want to love this place and there so many things to love. The staff, the bar, the menu, the presentation, the atmosphere, those French fries are in a whole world of awesome by themselves. The slaw is made to order because the creamy dressing hasn't softened the crunchy cabbage. The ribs I had as a replacement for the chicken friend stake were pretty damn good - though they got nothin' on Blackstrap BBQ. Oh and yeah, Whoopie Pies. \\n\\n\\nI'll also add that the service far exceeded my expectations for this type of place. The manager was very open minded and took note of my criticism and offered to on-the-house my next chicken fried steak. True pros all the way. Can't say that enough.\\n\\nTo be re-reviewed in the future. I ain't giving up on it yet."}

{"label":0,"text":"Are you a BRIDE thinking about having your wedding here? STOP!\\nCan you give a place no stars? This place has HORRIBLE reviews of JUST the HOTEL, despite their so called \\\"Renovations\\\" , so beware! And I'm not even complaining about their Hotel! This review (Or RANT ha ha) is for the EVENTS\/WEDDING  department. STAY AWAY! wasted 6 months of precious planning time working with Janeen and Tricia from the Plaza.  I was given tours of the property and what was \\\"coming\\\" and promised how awesome the new banquet rooms would be. My first mistake.\\nI was even promised 2009 event food and booze pricing for my wedding because of the inconvenience of their renovations. Because of that, I decided on the Plaza. A few months later, I was finally suckered into signing a contract and giving them a 500.00 deposit.. Then, I finally SAW the \\\"new\\\" banquet rooms. My BAD.\\nThey were normal, boring banquet rooms, and most of the area in them wasn't even NEW, including the carpet! If that wasn't enough of a joke, the two vendor companies the Plaza referred me to, to help decorate my event, were shockingly unprofessional. \\nOne, called Ltevention, never returned calls or emails over a one month period, and the other, a lady named Maya, scoffed at me as a client because I had 'GASP' a budget! (In this economy, can you IMAGINE?)\\n She expected me to want to shell out over 6000.00 just for floor to ceiling draping to make the room, as she put it, more \\\"stylish\\\" ....in addition to all the linens, flowers, etc., that I wanted. (Never mind that I thought that since the room would have been a lot more elegant as promised over and OVER by the Plaza, why would draping even be necessary? It is, after all, an OPTION!)\\n Then, to add insult to serious injury, when I told her I wasn't interested in those types of items, just simple flowers, linens and chair covers, her whole attitude and demeanor changed. She got snotty! After several attempts to contact her to finalize the rental of the simple items I did want, she chickened out of any contact with me, and enlisted the Plaza to tell me that she \\\"would not work with me.\\\" And this was a vendor that my contracted Hotel, the PLAZA referred me to!! What?! So basically, I don't have enough money in my lowly budget to waste your time....Well, sorry. LOTS of people are on a wedding budget and don't have 30,000 to spend on a wedding. As a couple, we are paying for all of this ourselves.\\n I was appalled that in this economy ANY vendor in any type of industry could SCOFF at taking on a client, no matter their budget. Unbelievable. \\nWhen I expressed my frustration to the Plaza about these two quacks, (that THEY referred me to, mind you) they were of no help. All I got was the \\\"too bad that's the way it is\\\" song and dance. (Just more professional sounding and wordy.)Then they repeatedly tried to professionally distance themselves from these \\\"outside\\\" vendors by saying just that... \\\"They don't officially work for us, blah blah\\\"..but who cares? Don't they have any sense of professional integrity? That fact remains that the Plaza assured me that they would take stress and frustration out of the process for me by referring vendors. What about THAT promise?\\nBy that point, they had my 500.00 for only 16 days and JUST the day before I had been emailed menus so I could actually, after MONTHS, finally start planning what my guests could eat. But by that time I had a BAD taste in my mouth, especially about the crappy banquet room, so I respectfully asked for my deposit back, in writing. (Yes, I did write \\\"respectfully\\\" in my written request. I can show it to you.) Not that I stood a chance.\\nBecause of course, no respect was given. Sure, officially I signed, and I knew they were gonna take my money and run, but I thought maybe, just MAYBE, because of the way their vendors handled me, and the fact that up to that point the only thing I had planned with them was seeing their craptacular ball room and I was pushed around and ignored, that I could appeal to any sort of professional ethics they might have and just respectfully bow out, hopefully with my deposit. I was so wrong. So I'm out $500.00, but I'd rather be out that than work with this dump. They have greedily keep the 500.00 which they did not in ANY way rightfully earn. \\nThey lied about their commitment to work with me. The contract should have read..\\\"We will help you only if you spend much more than what was discussed on your event. If not, you're on your own.\\\" And just so my fellow yelpers know, I am so not a \\\"Bridezilla.\\\" All I want is a great party! But if you want to keep it simple, the Plaza completely abandons you and just gives you four ugly banquet walls and food. \\nOh, BTW, the whole place still stinks BADLY of cigarette smoke, just like in days of yore. Which is fitting. Cause they stink."}

I followed that with a full plate of mac and cheese, french toast, pizza, mushroom ravioli, large plate of desserts.

I had deprived myself over the week and needed, wanted more?

Whatever, I'm okay with it.\\n\\nOkay, well, I ate the sugar cookie almost immediately and thought it to be quite fluffy and the frosting was not at all overwhelming. Later that evening, I ate that cream cookie sandwich and it was so worth it. It's like eating cupcake frosting sandwiched between two soft chocolate chip cookies. Well, that's exactly what it is. Yum! I wanted more. But I have to suppress my fatty desires. The following day, I ate the pumpkin tart, after I had refrigerated it, and it was like a mini pumpkin pie.

They made a big fuss about our complaint and two different people came over to the table to discuss why we didn't like the risotto.  They insulted us by insinuating that we didn't know that saffron has a different taste, whatever......it was still bad. When we received the bill it was taken off, all $4.99 of it.

I had no trouble making a reservation and our table was ready when I arrived on time. \\n\\nWhen I try sushi, I usually don't stray away from the shrimp, crab, or tuna varieties, so I was happy to see that they have a wide variety of specialty rolls that I haven't seen at other restaurants. We arrived just before HH ended so I got an order of gyoza to share and a drink, both of which were good. For dinner I ordered the bull roll (spicy tuna, crab, cucumber topped with beef) and the becca roll (spicy crab, jalapeno, cilantro, cucumber). The Bull Roll is the one in the pics wrapped in foil and set ablaze. I described it as tasting like dinner - the beef on top was so delicious and the roll gets hot so with the rice and everything it tastes like you're eating a warm dish (tastes better than it may sound). I also really enjoyed the Becca roll. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their rolls and they even brought out some mochi for the birthday boy.

We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white\/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\\n\\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \\n\\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \\\"Emerel's Blend\\\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner."}

I wasn't really sure if I wanted to eat here due to being overpriced and mediocre reviews, but I figured we should at least give it a chance.\\n\\nFor appetizer we got deviled eggs which were really good.\\n\\nI got the Shepard's Pie. It was so bland. I was rather disappointed with that.\\n\\nMy boss got a sandwich that was essentially two giant pieces of bruschetta. She didn't enjoy that.\\n\\nMy coworkers got fish and chips and the beef burger. You would think the burger would be just as good as the burgers at Burgr, but it wasn't. \\n\\nThe service was ridiculously bad. We asked for ketchup and salt, waited forever, finally was able to flag down the waiter again and he said yeah, I'm working on it. Who says that and why would it take so long to get ketchup and salt?? Everyone was trying to eat slow, waiting for the condiments...\\n\\nThe desert was amazing though. I got the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle. If I were to go back here, I would just order that desert. And maybe the deviled eggs."}

My girlfriend and I started with the jalapeno hummus which was wondrous! The pita was great and light which didn't take away from the great flavor of the hummus. For my entree I went with the Mediterranean salad which was one of their specials and I LOVED it! A mix of lettuces, tomato, red onion. tabulli, roasted red peppers, pine nuts, golden raisins, and feta cheese topped with a very light lemon dressing made for an awesome dinner. As I looked around the restaurant I wondered how I could possibly make my way back to Pita Jungle before the move. Don't make the same mistake I did-get your ass to Pita Jungle stat!

They did a thorough job cleaning out the interior and the outside was spotless, all for the basic wash price.  Maybe they took extra care since they weren't very busy on a Monday afternoon.  This place can be a zoo at the lunch hour or after work, so mid afternoon's during the midweek are highly recommended.\\n\\nAn extra bonus is I have been receiving $4 off coupons in the mail fairly regularly, so as long as they keep that off they have a loyal customer!"}

Why GRINGO?  or is this place is only for whites.  I wouldnt eat here ever.  If you want good street tacos, go to a real mexican resturant, at least youll get sides with it and real food.

Had an unwelcoming experience with no communication as to hotel accommodations, breakfast, New Years dinner, the pool, internet etc until I asked. Several elevators were not working and were very slow. Hotel lobby bathrooms were closed all evening,  making us go to our room to use the facilities. Very inconvient. With it being New years, I would have staffed the hotel bar with more staff. Also better advertisements as to specials for New Years etc. Had more fun experiencing local bars! Hotel staff were not very friendly."}
{"label":0,"text":"I have stayed here a few times before, but many years ago. It has steadily gone downhill.  They now charge the much-hated \\\"Resort Fee\\\", which is a sleazy way of hiding the true cost of your stay. They also charge for internet access. VERY slow internet access. According to Cox Comm they have very old equipment at the Stratosphere and do not want to pay for the upgrade.  A 25 year old analog TV has a better picture than the TV in my room. I got my revenge by doing ALL my gambling and eating elsewhere. So the $27\/day charges for Resort Fees and internet access was all they got. The other big downside is that all the action happens further down the strip and cab fares in Las Vegas are outrageous."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not a very good buffet. Eggs were bland, eggs bendict reminded me of a mcdonalds egg mcmuffin, sushi had no flavor either. Only good things I found were the cheese blintzes, the omelette bar was really good as well and the only good eggs I had. Most of the deserts were pretty poor quality, the only good thing was the pudding. Overall not worth the price. Drink service was good at first but then they switched waitresses and I didn't get a refill once they switched. Maybe lunch or dinner is better...I would hope."}

No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes. \\nWas it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob.\\nWas it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.\\n\\nSure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.\\n\\nAs we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back.

The sausage they used was sliced up cheap links, and the potatoes they used were the frozen shredded variety.

Yes, I do have other neighborhood bars that I casually have a drink at but Rips has great drink specials, the star-like ceiling is beautiful, and i love that it's also showcasing local artwork on its wall. \\n\\nWhat Phoenix was lacking was a rocking dance night. Since Hot Pink ended its Friday nights at Carumba's, Obscura at Rips has definitely filled the void. I definitely get pumped up for second Saturdays! I love dancing to music you don't hear everyday on the radio and the mix those two DJs spin is just what the doctor order after a long day of retail.\\n\\nDrinks, oh the drinks! Rips has an array of liquors and beers. Pinnacle vodkas...what flavor do they not make? I think I saw around a dozen different flavors from Pomegranate to Cotton Candy! Every time I return I try a new one.\\nBut most of all, I love the fact the owner kept the original vintage sign.  With the over sized red arrow outlined in light bulbs, you'll have no problem spotting it when driving down 16th street. I suggest you check it out and befriend the bar on Facebook because you don't want to miss out on specials or events."}

The crab legs and cooked jumbo shrimp make it worth paying the premium prices here.  Dessert and gelato are also tasty so save some room if that is even possible.\\n\\nThe overall feel of this buffet is upscale and they are very nice about not rushing you to finish.

I'm always down for good Mexican food so we hopped in the Mom-mobile and were on our way! \\n\\nI ordered the Friday special which was 2 hand tacos with choice of rice or beans. You could choose chicken or beef and I asked for one of each and asked for a side of beans as well as I wanted to get the full flavor. My friend had the street tacos pastor, asado, and carnitas style.We also shared chips and salsa with guacamole.\\n\\nI ended up getting 2 beef tacos and no beans. I didn't want to make a stink about it because I didn't pick the restaurant but when I asked at the counter about the beans, they said they would bring them out and never did. Luckily my baby had beans with his cheese quesadilla so I did get to try them but meh..they were just ok. The spanish rice was under-seasoned and all I could taste was salty chicken broth. The guacamole was pretty tasty though the avocado was overpowered by the salsa that was mixed in to it. The salsa was very tasty. And I was kind of surprised that the chips and the hard shells on the tacos weren't house made or if they were...they've got it down to such a science that they seem store bought. \\n\\nMy friend enjoyed his street tacos but he agreed about the rice being under-seasoned and over-brothed. \\n\\nThe staff at the counter were nice, but they were firmly planted there. No one came by the tables to check on people and even though we chose to sit outside, they didn't move from their spot to let us know our food was ready. \\n\\nI'll go back to try again if we are in the area because my friend really likes it there and I want to try to get what he's seeing but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back without him."}

The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.\\n\\nHOWEVER.....\\n\\nEVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.

However \\\"Complimentary High Speed internet\\\" does not mean high speed wi-fi, so we had to take turns plugging our laptops in or dragging our shit into the lobby, which was the one place where the wi-fi actually worked (even though it was super slow, high-speed my ass!) The \\\"Fitness Centre\\\" consisted of a treadmill, a bike and some weights, which looked as though they had all been purchased in the 70's, and since the room had no windows you could open, it got really stuffy, really fast. \\n\\nI think my favourite part of our week-long stay though was the housekeeping. Now, I don't mean to blame the housekeepers, but since the hotel had given out discounts for all the out-of-town people who were staying there for festival, you would think they would not wake us up at the ungodly hour of 8am, especially since the festival went until 3am, not to mention any afterparties... In any case, we went to the front desk to see about getting a \\\"do not disturb sign\\\" and they told us they didn't have any. So we decided to draw a picture of us sleeping and turn it into a home-made sign. Magically, a \\\"do not disturb\\\" sign appeared on our door handle the next morning! Hallelujah! We were safe to sleep in for the rest of the trip!  \\n\\nThe hotel did offer a complimentary breakfast, if you were able to drag your hungover ass down to the lobby before 10am, and honestly free doesn't always = good.

My bf and I are staying at the hotel and thought we would go down and get some breakfast to go. There was only one person in line ahead of us and they got a coffee and a pastry.

By this time his bagel was cold so we asked for a new one. The one they gave us seemed a bit greasy, but we didn't think much of it. I finally got my food and the lady was nice enough to give me a fruit cup for free (which here is $6). While we were waiting, there were also other people waiting forever for their food and they too had to go say something and then and only then did they get their food.\\n\\nSo...the bagel was so greasy it was literally falling apart. My scramble was amazing, but it definitely looked a little rushed. \\n\\nThis place is consistent in that, the food is really good, but it takes forever to get it.

But that just did not make up for the poor quality food. The bruschetta was pretty good, we got the tomato, pesto and salami, and roasted peppers and goat cheese. I liked the latter 2, but the tomato was...meh. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Like other readers, I found the chicken to taste weird. I asked the server where it was cooked (suspected it was a fully cooked frozen patty when they purchased it), and after avoiding me for about 10 mins, I asked again, and she said her cook was on break and she'd have the answer soon. Answer was that they overnight the chicken, and she overemphasized that they keep it in the refrigerator until they use it, or they freeze it before it goes bad. Well whoop de do! Good for you, MG! You refrigerate your meat!! Anyway, things were just not good, and it seems like they cut corners in a lot of places by buying pre-made food items and not really cooking anything from scratch. My husband got the BBQ cheddar burger and the bun was huge but the burger patty was itty bitty. Just because you have a huge bun doesn't fool me on the actual burger size!

The restaurant had a total of 6 patrons and we were seated  and waited for 8 minutes until I asked somehow who my server once, because the server was talking to ignoring us, same circumstance as the first visit. I am super dissapointed in the service, but the food is good. Customer service needs to get way better there though!!!!"}
{"label":1,"text":"Visited here a week after they opened. Cool atmosphere and loved the finishes inside the place. The server was friendly but it took us 50 minutes to get our two beers we ordered! The beer list is located at the back of the bar which was a little difficult to see honestly from all the tables.  I would say the food was just so-so and seemed greasy to me.  \\n\\nWe tried the spud tacos (a little blah and lacked a whole lot of flavor),  the avocado salad (which had greens that were extremely bitter and three small pieces of grapefruit) and the 810 sandwich (which had okay flavor but was greasy). In total, our dinner, took nearly two hours! Luckily I was not in a rush that evening or I would have been extremely frustrated. \\n\\nHopefully they'll get the kinks worked out as they are open longer but I can't say I'll be going back."}
{"label":3,"text":"One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \\n\\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \\\"good old days\\\" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\\n\\nRustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \\n\\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\\n\\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\\n\\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\\n\\nFor the meal, I had the \\\"catch of the day\\\" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \\n\\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \\n\\nProbably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns."}
{"label":1,"text":"Overrated. \\n\\nI think I ordered the wrong steak but at $60 a steak, I still expected a good steak. \\n\\nI read the reviews and I still ordered the bone in since bone in has such good flavor. Yes, I understand it wouldn't be the most tender cut of meat, but it was chewy. I have had much better steaks in texas (also corn fed like they highly describe on their menu and by the waiter) than at cut. \\n\\nThe rest - the sides were ok. i really enjoyed the mac and cheese that gets prepped (stirred) at the table as well as the spinach with egg. But the other sides were just ok. \\n\\nWine\/drink: they had a drink menu on an ipad and yes that's impressive but when it's a group of seven (mostly guys - i was the lone girl) it might be smart to give us more than one unit. \\n\\nThe cheesy bread was amazing - that's the only reason this place got two stars. \\n\\nService was great - but expected at a place of this size. \\n\\nAll said and done, I paid two hundred dollars for my meal of a bad steak and ok mac and cheese. \\n\\nwill not come again."}
{"label":1,"text":"I am in a monthly rental and the AC goes out. I reluctantly called the Home Warranty co. To schedule an appt. They showed up fairly quickly, but the tech was not very friendly, spent a LONG time looking at the unit and then told me he \\\"temporarily\\\" fixed it until it really breaks. OK? A few hours later the house is hotter, call back for another appt. The next guy out looks at the unit and tells me he can't fix it tonight that it needs to thaw out first. (Its summer in phoenix, not gonna happen) Total BS...my husband had to tell him how to fix it and once he finally listened, he was able to make the repair. Crappy service, rude employees."}
{"label":2,"text":"LINE: When I went it was about 3am leaving Marquee, the line was fairly short but it can get pretty long because this place is pretty small and the sitting area had about 6 chairs. \\n\\nPIZZA: alright I'm not much of a pizza lover but I liked the concept of \\\"secret pizza\\\" because it is down a long hall way and I would've never guessed there was a pizza joint in that hole in the wall. \\n\\nPRICE: pricy but its Vegas, I ordered 4 slices and 1 drink came to about $27. Also I had no objections at that point I would've eaten anything. Drunk food is scarfed down."}
{"label":3,"text":"Sensi was a refreshing change from the lights, activity, and general overstimulation of Vegas. The entry features a refreshing waterfall in the background, cozy yet intimate dining with succulents on each table, and an open kitchen allowing one to view the chefs rolling dough for fresh naan. Which leads me to the naan- it was delicious! Crisp, soft, and nicely charred with a flavourful dipping sauce. \\n\\nThe waiter was attentive and accommodating. I am a vegetarian and my sister, gluten intolerant, and he was more than willing to modify dishes if needed. A ordered a butternut squash gnocchi with pickled pear, brussels sprouts leaves, and a touch of parmesan. All of the vegetables complimented one another without being overpowering and the presentation was well thought out. Overall, it was a relaxing evening and I would return for the atmosphere and fresh, flavourful dishes."}

{"label":4,"text":"******CASINO REVIEW ONLY******\\n\\nI've never stayed at the hotel so I'm writing this review strictly on the casino. It is by far my favorite casino in the Las Vegas area. Now, I should admit that I never play slots, and no, not because I think they're for \\\"suckers\\\" I just don't enjoy them. (Let's be honest, if you gamble at all... you're a bit of a sucker... these places aren't made of solid gold for no reason :-) Back to business; right when I walked in, I knew that it was going to be my kind of place. It's never ridiculously crowded. The drink servers greeted me right away and took my order. The table limits allow you to play at the level YOU decide you are comfortable with. Also, if you're a dice player, this is the only casino in Nevada that I've noticed has a Fire Bet. There is a great, reasonably priced food court if you want to grab a bite to eat and don't feel like taking out a 2nd on your house. It really is the ONLY place I feel comfortable gambling at in Nevada. 5 stars for the Jolly Green Giant. \\n\\nRegards,\\nCFC"}

There you go!"}
{"label":1,"text":"I'm probably at between 1 and 2 stars but I guess I'll round up since I've never seen any bug or so enter my apartment (I was on the 7th floor) and I'll try to be very very unbiased here but if you want to the sweet short version:\\n\\nWouldn't recommend. Can absolutely find better for a lower price. Please do me a favor and rent elsewhere.\\n\\nThe long version (it's going to be really really long, but informative):\\n\\n1) Location is great - right by UNLV. I'm a student, however, the small charges here are awful. $30 a month to park with a shade over your car, $50 additional on top of rent if you live above the 5th floor. Also, the back-end in entering the apartment tower is poorly built. if you are entering, you push. but let's say you're trying to get to the back-end from the apartment tower...it's also push. Which means you have two doors colliding all the time when people are trying to enter or exit the apartment.\\n\\n2) I had a deal when renting here..and didn't remember until I signed the lease why I didn't want to live here (myself included, and friends, lived here as a last resort, not by choice) and that's because at the end of your lease, rent increases by 10%. My deal though when renting here, $705 per month, so 8 months I would have coupons that deducted $200 off my rent price and the remaining 4 I would pay $985 (because I had a shade for my car $30\/per month then $50\/per month living above the 5th floor)\\n\\n3) To do laundry, you need a laundry card. Weird because when you enter the laundry room, there's a slot to insert quarters lulz. But yes, a laundry card to do laundry, per card is $10. after you load money onto this card is when you can proceed to do the actual laundry. It's weird how they dedeuct the money off your card when you get to $.50 and even worse because you can only load $2,$5,$10 and $20 bills... That's right, you cannot even load $1 bills and\/or coins.\\n\\n4) Their lease, is ridiculous. When you sign, do beware that you CANNOT break it under any terms (my reason for this whole review) also, when you move out, you know how you have to give a month in advance? BE SURE TO DO THIS. Because if not, ON THE LEASE, it states \\\"if failure to do so, the lease will continue on until an additional 12 months\\\" ... which means, if you don't tell them you're leaving, you're bind to that apartment for an additional YEAR. \\n\\n5) I never understood why it was very important to know if you could break a lease. What happened with me unfortunately was that I got severely ill and had to move out of state and I was already 6 months into my lease. My co-signer, my father, was able to pay rent (hardly knew English and had to get consist help from the bf to deliver the rent because we were all out of state) and with that, therefore I was bind to my lease. Such assholes. They're smart though, getting a co-signer. But serious assholes. Because failure to pay, would ruin my dad's credit. The property managers or agents working there were no help of this situation. Sure they were symapethic but because it was \\\"Vegas tower management\\\" who had said no, it wasn't in their power or control to do anything - these people are a bunch of turd.\\n\\n6) Lastly, after being through everything, and reading all the reviews here, I wanted to make sure I received my security deposit back of $500. I kid you not, I spent literally 2 and a half weeks, thoroughly cleaning my apartment, even cleaning the bolt cap cover kit of my bathroom to laying newspaper around my kitchen to make sure my shoes don't leave marks after I wipe. And in the end, I did receive it but absolutely busted my ass too.\\n\\nSadly this place won't ever closed. They're more affordable than Las Vegas Grand and more secure than other apartments around the area.\\n\\nBut when getting the mail, the mailman would show me at least half the rooms are vacant...\\n\\nAnd now you know why."}
{"label":3,"text":"We stopped here for brunch after a single night in Montreal. The food was excellent. My wife enjoyed the oysters, and I loved my Lobster Benedict.

{"label":4,"text":"I'm surprised I don't see better reviews for this place.  Out of all the clubs I've been to in Vegas thus far (LAX, Tryst, Studio 54, Jet, etc.) The Bank was my best experience yet.  The club is stellar.  About 15 friends and I got a VIP section on the dance floor.  We got two bottles of Grey Goose and ordered another later that night.  We were greeted by our waitress who was not only beautiful but sweet.  She was very accommodating and attentive.  She quickly brought over freshly squeezed orange juice, (none of that fake bar OJ we have in Hawaii) cranberry juice and cans and cans of Red Bull.  She made each of our drinks and left us to party.  We had our own personal buss boy who was just as attentive.  With just a drip of condensation on the ground and he was there to clean it up.  The bathroom wasn't even 10 steps away from our section and we even had a security guard who escorted us there.  I've never received service as attentive and upscale.  Later that night, there was a gentleman throwing dollar bills throughout the night.  I made an easy 15 bucks.  But don't go in expecting to make a few bucks from partying at The Bank, I think he was just an extremely well to do socialite.  All in all, it was a great evening...even some incriminating pictures to prove it.  We all can't wait to plan our next trip back."}
{"label":1,"text":"Parking was a nightmare and I quickly made the decision that walking from the residential block behind the strip of commercial property would be easier than waiting for a spot to open up.

I debated taking it back, but decided that I would just live with it because I was super hungry. On the upside, the cookie was good. I wouldn't order the sandwich again."}

{"label":1,"text":"I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \\n\\nFor starters, the \\\"drive thru\\\" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your \\\"food,\\\" at which point you're beyond the entrance\/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\\n\\nIt's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe.\\n\\nOk... entrance\/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming\/food prep\/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\\n\\nToday's experience was especially interesting\/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\\n\\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a \\\"large #3 with Coke.\\\"  \\n\\nMcD's Microphone Dude: \\\"Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"Do you want a large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Yes, and the #3.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"So, that's a #3 with large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Ok.\\\"\\n\\nMe: (long pause) \\\"Can I continue with the order?\\\"  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\\n\\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready.\\n\\nMe: ...drives around...\\n\\nKid at window: \\\"That'll be $18.14.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal.\\\"\\n\\nKid at window: \\\"You can.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"So, why all of the confusion?\\\"\\n\\nKid: \\\"I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Oh, ok.\\\"\\n\\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\\n\\nI returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\\n\\n\\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold\/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\\n\\nThanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.

Of course, I had entree envy, as always, and drooled over my brother-in-law's order of Asian style short ribs. They were SO tender. I ordered the mushroom pan fry, which was served over polenta. All in all, it was a good dish. The sauce wasn't so creamy that I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant afterward, and it had a nice level of spiciness (hence the Southwestern edge).

I guess its cuz they're \\\"specialty\\\" drinks and rolls so 6 bucks is a steal for them?  Not that much of a thrifty deal.

The pork wasnt that spicy like it promised,  very little hollandaise, way too much pork and the english muffin was super burnt - it was so burnt I could smell it and see it through the dark adovado sauce.  I kind of wonder if they knew the sauce would cover it and were too lazy to re-toast another one.  Unfortunately the waiter didn't come back for a good twenty minutes so I just ate a little of the pork and eggs.

{"label":2,"text":"Time for an update...\\n\\nWithin the past month I've visited Downtown Cocktail Room three times.  And whether it was through my personal experience or the experience of others in my party, things have left a generally sour taste in my mouth as of late.  There are a few things that have stood out in my recent visits:\\n\\n-The audacity of a specific bartender.  I always welcome a bartender\/mixologists opinion when it comes to recommendations for spirits and cocktails, but this individual comes across as arrogant and presumptuous.  He offers suggestions for DCR-original creations, and then openly admits that all of his recommendations are his own creation.  This came up after a customer had inquired about a drink on the Spring menu, and the bartender said that he wasn't the one who created the drink.  In addition, he ignored a customers request for a cocktail made with a specific spirit, stating that he doesn't work with it; he then waited for the customer to suggest a different spirit base for a cocktail.  As a side note, this bartender also rang up my bill incorrectly during this visit, over charging me for a drink.\\n\\n-Service.  Waitresses were not immediately willing to seat my party in the back area of DCR.  This was brought to my attention by another member of my party, as I arrived after they had.  They were told that there was no seating available, and we only ended up in the back area because a member of our party asked about it.  Am I to believe we would have been out of luck if we weren't aware of the back area?  Maybe.  After being seated, ordering our drinks, and then receiving our drinks, the waitress asked if we wanted to start a tab.  Standard procedure, that's cool.  Some individuals were done ordering and decided it would be easier on them to pay their portion of the bill now, instead of having their total added to a tab.  The waitress then proceeded to bring out the bill for everyone at the table.  Later in the night, when another party was seated in the back area, the waitress took an empty chair from our table without asking us if it was taken.\\n\\n-Did you know there was a $20 minimum if you're going to use a credit card\/debit card?  I sure didn't.  After going here for the better part of two years, that issue has never come up; I know this because I often don't carry cash, and also usually order only two drinks (which will keep the bill below $20).  However, on a recent visit, I ordered one drink for myself and another drink for a friend, for a total bill of $19.  First of all, the bill was brought to us right after our drinks were delivered.  Really?  You want me out of there that bad?  After handing the bill back with my debit card, the waitress stated that there was a $20 minimum and that they would have to add $1 to my bill so that I could use my card.  My card is Visa; if this establishment accepts Visa, then they also accept all fees due upon Visa transactions from customers.\\n\\n-Responses to Yelp reviews:  Eight out of the ten lowest scored reviews have received a response from Michael C. of Downtown Cocktail Room.  Not one comment or response, however, was given to reviews over three stars.  It's one thing to step up and address concerns with reviews that you feel are not a valid representation of your business; however these responses avoid the overall commentary of the reviews, and a number of them end with something along the lines of, \\\"Come by DCR and form your own opinion.\\\"  Normally I wouldn't nitpick and pull out a statistic like I did above, but it surprised me to hear about the feedback that people had received for their reviews (three stars or lower), while I had not gotten any feedback for my review (five stars).  It's a little disheartening to see all the attention the negative reviews receive, while the glowing reviews from regular customers appear to go unnoticed (until their rating goes down, in which case the deduction of two stars in a review prompted a response that ended with, \\\"Thanks for all of the past support!\\\")\\n\\nThanks for all of the past support?  Well, your welcome for all of mine as well.  We'll see how things go from here, as I'm sure I'll end up here again; probably just not twice a month as I have in the past."}

{"label":3,"text":"My wife and two kids (ages 2 and 4) came here for a 10th anniversary celebration vacation. Couldn't really complain much. Room was nice, housekeeping was considerate (picked up our kids toys and placed them nicely on the cabinet). On our first day, they delivered milk and cookies for the kids for free.\\n\\nLocation is okay; probably a great location for a business trip. There isn't much downtown for kids so while the hotel certainly accomodated us well, the surrounding business don't really make much of an effort to cater to families.\\n\\nMaybe we got lucky but we booked the hotel with a special summer promotion they were running and the price ended up being the cheapest of the major downtown hotels. Some of the bad reviews seem to suggest this hotel is expensive so I could understand how my expections might be higher if I paid a lot more. \\n\\nAs other reviewers have stated, book the hotel directly through their website instead of Expedia, Orbitz, etc. If you do that and sign up for their rewards program, the wifi is free.\\n\\nThey have a pool but it's outdoors. \\n\\nWe did self-parking at a garage nearby which saved us about $10 per day compared to the hotel's valet parking. It's convenient to buses and the Metro."}

Like all honey toast, it takes about 15 minutes. You can choose what type of ice cream you want. I recommend strawberry :) It was baked perfectly and the ice cream wasn't drastically melting. Although I enjoyed eating the honey toast, I had a hard time eating it because they have given me plastic forks.

{"label":3,"text":"I went in today to use the self dog wash facilities with my 14 year old Cairn Terrier.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful.  The environment is overall very clean.  The place is a bit older and the tubs and equipment show wear.  The water is plenty warm and the pressure can go up to super high. The available shampoo and conditioner are hypoallergenic.  I decided to use my own shampoo since I prefer the smell.  Brushes are also provided, but again, I used my own.  The dryer has a super high blower motor, which removes the water, but doesn't use heat..  I had the staff trim the nails on my dog, they did a quick, gentle job. The dogs do roam freely in the sectioned off day care room.  There is a frequent customer punch card, if you buy five washes, the sixth is free."}
{"label":4,"text":"I stumbled into this place while waiting for another local restaurant to open for breakfast.  Me and a friend sat at the bar for a quick mimosa and bloody mary.  The bartender was trying to get us to stay but after one look at the menu we promised we would be back the next weekend!\\n\\nI think I have found my new favorite brunch location.  Their Sunday Brunch special is the best in town.  An entree, a little crustini, and all the bloody marys\/mimosas you can drink....great deal!!!  RED VELVET PANCAKES....Amazing!  These were the best pancakes I've had in a long time.  These cakes are topped with marscarpone creme and a side of bacon is a great breakfast combo!  A friend tried the Chilequiles.  This is the prefect combination of shredded pork, eggs, and chili....yum!  The Breakfast Steak and Eggs were another great treat.  The fingerling potatoes were a great side.  \\n\\nI highly recommend a Sunday stop at the Herb Box.  Its a great local place on the Waterfront and be a great place for Sunday Funday!"}

She \\\"forgot\\\" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  \\n\\nVideo poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank.

{"label":3,"text":"My guess is that the National experience is quite variable based on whether you're a member of their Emerald Club.

Generally speaking, this is a great thing as it gives a person a fair number of options while speeding up the getaway from the airport.\\n\\nI haven't ever had a bad experience renting from National at McCarran, however this time, my vehicle's windows and mirrors seemed to have been cleaned with a dirty towel so there was a lot of smearing. I didn't note this in the dark garage but it was noticeable in the sunlight and affected my visibility somewhat. Hence, what would have been a 5 star review becomes 4 stars. Yeah, seems like a little thing, but driver visibility is important to safety, so they deserve the knock down for this."}

It easily used to be a 5-star restaurant, but ever since it changed chefs, you can tell a difference. \\n\\nWell, let me rephrase, the food is still top quality, but the menu selection is not. If you do not eat or enjoy red meat or do not eat dairy, like me, there are just not very many quality options. I went to Top of the World last weekend with my best friend and frankly the only thing I could eat was vegetable soup and salmon. Don't get me wrong, it was very good but given that salmon was one of the few fish options shocked me, especially at a restaurant like Top of the World. \\n\\nI was also very surprised to see that the dessert menu decimated to the level that it was. This place use to have this dessert option that was basically like a tower of chocolate that was incredible, but not only was that option gone, but so were many other options. \\n\\nHaving said all of this, the soup, salmon and everything else I had was very good. I also tried my friends crab cake and that was very good. But again, it was one of the few things that I could eat. \\n\\nHowever, the view that Top of the World still offers cannot be beat and it is still a very romantic and intimate atmosphere. \\n\\nIn closing,  I believe the quality of food is still amazing, but if you are not a meat or dairy eater, then your menu options are very limited and probably would be happier at another restaurant."}

Of course, I haven't eaten at every restaurant in Vegas, but for the 6 or 7 high-end places I've been, I have always been disappointed.

{"label":3,"text":"Ah golden dragon I heart you. My grandmother is the one who showed us this little gem-apparently its very popular with the sun city (65+) crowd, but who can blame them? They have a killer ayce dinner special for $11.50pp but surprise... It's NOT buffet style. You order off a full menu and everything is made fresh to order! Make sure if you are doing the ayce to let the server know before you start ordering. \\n\\nYou start off with the appetizers and soup. They have the standard selection of apps; egg rolls, potstickers, pork spare ribs, fried shrimp etc. etc. Tonight we got bbq pork, cream cheese wontons (10) and I got a cup of hot n sour soup. The apps came out fairly quickly and everything was hot and crispy. So much better then when it's buffet style sitting out under heat lamps and getting soggy! Then after apps you can order entrees and rice or noodles. They have a good selection of chicken, beef and seafood entrees as well as different fried rices, noodles and egg foo yung.\\n\\nWe ordered honey walnut shrimp, shrimp pad thai and mongolian beef to start. The walnut shrimp is my favorite it's so sweet and delicious. Not calorie friendly at all but that's what makes it so good. The mongolian beef was tasty but lacked spice. Actually now that I think of it all their \\\"spicy\\\" dishes are not spicy at all so I have to subtract 1 star! I like a little kick with my food especially when it is supposed to be spicy. Anyways we ordered another round of wontons and sweet n sour pork and I was so full after that my bf had to roll me out of there! \\n\\nA few things to note. If you order the ayce you MUST eat everything and they do frown upon leftover food. They have threatened to charge for any leftovers although it has yet to happen but just be aware. The portions are not huge but I do think they adjust the portion sized based on how many are in your party. I've gone with a party of 7 before and the entrees seemed to be bigger whereas they seemed to have less food when it was just me and the bf. And lastly they don't require reservations but they are recommended for large party. Also keep in mind this review is for the dinner special ONLY. You could of course order ala carte items and they also have take out but this is the best deal and we all know how much I love a good deal! my suggestion would be to go with a group so you can sample a little bit of everything. :)"}

This is a wedding and people come from all over the world to be here, and you are saying they can't take pictures of each other?? The groom and bride haven't even come down yet. I could understand because you want to sell photos to the bride and groom, but these were just random pictures taken on an iphone. It was not like we had employed an outside photographer service. I did not like this.\\n\\nI also did not really enjoy our limo driver. I tipped him for my brother so he wouldn't have to, and when they were brought back, the driver (I will not put his name) told my brother that he had not been tipped. I was thoroughly pissed about this, as I wanted to take care of this so my brother didn't have to, and this man conned him into tipping more. Outrageous. The limo was also very dusty inside, and the man drove a little weird with the window open. There was no privacy for us on our ride over. \\n\\nI was really looking forward to this place. The room was nice, the photographer was awesome, but as for the ambiance, it is really lacking here. The girl was also rude at the counter when we went to pay for the rest of the wedding."}

I showed her the reponse changed to okay I am going to check with the manager. She then left and came back and informed me that she couldnt find a manger, saying since we are sooooo... busy. There at the time were 10 open tables. She then ask us to come back to use the coupon again saying soo ... busy. We just ordered and tried to move passed it. She continued to bring it up 3 more times. Became very annoying. Food was fine. I had not expected a coupon and would have probably been fine with the overall experience, but I feel it is in poor taste to offer a coupon and then not honor it. Then with the waitress continually bringing it up and making excuses was unpleasent when we had not mentioned it since we first showed her and she began with excuses. So my overall rating would be average on the food, atmosphere better than average. Most employees were friendly and prompt with service but our waitress experience was poor that combined with an enticment of coupon and then nit honoring makes the experience below average."}

Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.\\nTurns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.

You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.\\nThe burger patties are different... they're about 1\/8\\\" thick and seem pressed\/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded\/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.

I was starving by the time we got there because it took much longer to find it than I anticipated. Chandler Blvd goes very far west. I was also overdressed (loungy you are not Babaloos). The restaurant itself is in a strip mall (albeit a slightly fancier strip mall than one on Thomas Rd. in Central Phoenix but a strip mall nonetheless). The service was slow; I guess those Grupon's really threw them off their game. We ordered a salad and an appetizer (both unappetizing and unforgettable), I was ready to throw in the towel and then the entrees came.\\n\\nWe ordered Berenjena con Sofrito (eggplant with sofrito) and Jicama a la Parilla (grilled jicama) which both came with platanos (the eggplant with tostones and the jicama with platano frito). We had to order another side of the platano fritos because they were that good. The eggplant was so packed with flavor, I didn't want my meal to end. The jicama made for a light entree, but sufficient for my partner. While the entrees were phenomenal, I'm not sure I'd make a trip back, given the distance and the high prices. I may just stick with Havana Cafe."}

There's one where you strike a pose and you summon a superhero based on your pose. 8 out of 10 people would change their pose and summon the same superhero. Also, there's nowhere to sit. You wait in line after line and nowhere to sit. By the end, we were excited for the sitting ride. That actually was a cool part; really, the only cool part.

This was like visiting a holy place I didn't even know existed. \\nI chatted for a few minutes with the front counter woman. She was super nice, friendly and had lots to say about the museum. It consists of a few pictures and some costumes, letters and playbills. Per the young lady, they rotate their displays fairly constantly due to the space restrictions.

Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another. \\n\\nThis place consistently delivers a great dining experience.

Then we waited 45 mins to walk on the Skywalk.  When we got there the visitor center is not even finish yet.  It was till gutted.  I guess once the visitor center is finish the fee will go up.

{"label":3,"text":"You wanna' talk \\\"all you can eat Brasilian BBQ?\\\"...... Here's my qualifier.\\n\\nOur family, on my wife's side, is Brasilian. (In Brazil, it's spelled with an \\\"s\\\"). Over the last 30 years or so, I've eaten at the most complete churracarias both in Brasil and here. And I've eaten at the most modest; including a churracaria in a gas station in Sul de Minas on the way to visit a coffee cooperative. (see my youtube video titled, \\\"Coffee Cupping in Sul de Minas.\\\") The defining\/qualifying points are the same; quality and flavor of the meat, completeness of the salad bar, or \\\"bars\\\", (Some restaurants have a full sushi bar, with chef!), and quality of service. . So trying to remain both objective and relevant, I'll share my opinion.\\n\\nI've been to the Fogos in Dallas, Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas. My best experience was in Dallas, but understanding that I was there right after their opening, and because Fogo corporate is in Dallas, I think they worked at \\\"doing it all\\\". This was probably before they reviewed and revised their operations. (?) Dallas was the best. Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas, were both a disappointment, but more because they do not reflect the best of what I expect in a \\\"high end\\\" churrascaria. And I personally think they're making a mistake. Here's what most non-Brasilians are missing....... but wouldn't know it if they've never been to a more \\\"typical\\\" churrascaria in Brasil.\\n\\nThe salad bar.... In Brasil, and at churrascarias like Fogo in Sao Paulo, Rio, and the interior cities like Brasilia, Goiania and Uberlandia, there will be everything you see at Fogo in LV, plus another full bar of hot entrees, including fish and meat dishes, stroganoff, hot vegetables, rice and black beans. And yes, the fried plantans too. All this is available at the bar, all you can eat, not brought to your table like at Fogo. You'll also see that \\\"cheese bread\\\" called \\\"pao de queiju.\\\" In some restaurants, there'll be either a small, or very expanded sushi bar. The salad bar, by itself, can easily support anyone's craving for a full meal. Fogo's salad bar is amazingly small, in my opinion, and for Brasililans, incomplete... especially for the money! Fogo offers the \\\"salad bar only\\\" for under $30... but in my opinion, it's not worth it. If they had a traditionally full salad bar offering, it would be great for non-red meat eaters, as there would be a huge variety of fish, shrimp, etc. \\n\\nThe meats... Here, Fogo does well, as the quality of the meats is very good. While some churrascarias buy low end meats, my feeling is that what Fogo doesn't offer in the salad bar, they make up for in the meat department.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT... If you want rare, medium rare, well done, etc., you should tell both the table waiter, and the meat servers! I will sometimes tell the servers that I only want the Picanha (tri-tip), the Filet, and the Fraudinha (flank steak). You're paying... tell them what you want, and how you like it! They appreciate your specifics, and even at this Fogo, I got what I wanted in meats.\\n\\nThe service... For a high-end churrascaria, it was ill-timed meat delivery, and it was slow. And when the gauchos (meat servers) did start coming to the table, it was an \\\"onslaught.\\\" The mark of a great churrascaria is \\\"consistency\\\" with an even rhythm. We spoke to our waiter, assigned to manage our table, and I could see that he was struggling to maintain service level to us, and other tables. That issue alone... erradic service, would be a major complaint point. And for this Fogo, all I could think of was....... this would never fly in Sao Paulo, or Rio, or at any other of their Brasilian locations. \\n\\nA major deal breaker for Brasilians, and what told me this operation was tailored to \\\"Non-Brasilians\\\", was the fact that they serve rice and black beans only after being asked. Had I not asked, our table may have been overlooked. That's rediculous, as the foundation for a plate in Brasil is your rice, black beans, vinegrette salsa, and farofa, or toasted corn meal that tops off the beans rice and salsa. When you have to ask for those very basic items, you know that Fogo has tailored, or \\\"dumbed down\\\" their restaurant to non Brasilians. And frankly, most people love these items after being introduced, and shown how to \\\"build their plate.\\\"\\n\\nSo I gave Fogo a 4-star just because they do serve great quality meat. And knowing ignorance is bliss, I figure that if what they do serve is good, and the clientel like it. who am I to complain because they don't mimic my preferred style of service. (although....... I do think you deserve better than what they offer at their salad bar setup.)\\n\\nBTW..... for a more traditional salad bar, and certainly more complete, visit Texas de Brazil at the Town Square Shopping Center, off South Las Vegas Blvd. I think you'll better understand my comments about the salad bar, and maybe agree that the trade-off at Texas de Brazil may be in the quality of the meat."}

We chose the dinner for two, so we got to pick four meats. We chose filet mignon, shrimp, sword fish, and calamari. Everything was great! Although I was a bit confused when out chef served us the calamari, I was expecting a tiny intact squid, it looked like a slab of fish, but it was delicious none the less. It did seem however that a majority of the crowd was getting extremely drunk, they were shouting across the room and talking very loudly. There was a couple of families there with young children, which might have been more appropriate at a table instead of the grill because the chefs play with fire and squirts saki in your mouth. The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for, I was barely able to finish all the food they have me!! Overall it was a fun night and yummy food. I am looking forward to going back."}

As a business person, I will say out loud right here and now that the people in the restaurant are mistaken ... if the oh-so-important egg-ish stuff The Not-So-Good Egg pours on a fry griddle is so damned excellent then, well, the truth is that the only reason for this strictly business decision is that the product costs less, not more.\\n\\nMy family has been a customer of this chain - and this specific restaurant - for 15 years, and this not-fresh egg issue came as news to us. \\n\\nWe were not offered a discount when paying for our four meals.

Discovering that I must've left my receipt in the shopping bag holding the purse I couldn't return (due to the no-return policy of accessories there- deemed \\\"final sale\\\"), I stumbled upon the colorful Charming Charlie.  My vision unfettered by wooden walls, I gazed through floor-to-ceiling glass panes into the brightly-lit space and immediately realized that this everything-goes store is color-coded!  Not only does CC sell charms, but it also offers up non-leather purses (I'm assuming they're synthetic going by the tag prices of $35 to $50); bangles; snakeskin-patterned wallets ($15 or higher); custom jewelry; adorable floral headbands; $30 and up summery blouses; shoes; and, well, you name it, and CC probably sells it!  I was tempted to buy a lavender washed leather-look business card holder ($10), when I sadly realized that I wouldn't be able to use it at work due to certain guidelines.  \\n\\nI already have my eyes on a few pieces and would've walked out with a few items had I not been struck with thoughts of getting something to eat!  :)  Hope to return today before they close at 9p...\\n\\nFYI, return policy is 14 days w\/ receipt.  Clothing may be returned without the tag still on, as long as the tag accompanies the said item.  Restrictions?  Sales rep said that she wasn't positive, but clearance may be final sale.

{"label":1,"text":"Unfortunately I have to say even though this is a pretty nice Hotel, the fact that I was placed in a room with a window facing the Parking Structure and the stairs right in my face was a terrible experience, especially since I had to wake up early in the morning to the sound of people going up and down the metal parking stairs. That room should not even exists, and even if it does it shouldn't be assigned to anyone on a Sunday night when obviously 90% of the rooms were empty!!! Also there was weird noise coming out of the toilet pipes. \\n\\nEverything else was good but the kind of room I was in needs to be the last room given out, along with a warning from the front desk about it having a parking garage view with super loud stairways right in your ears!!

When I selected the gun, Simon then had me input my info into a PC, so I could do all the paperwork electronically- which I thought was super cool, and fast. While Simon was working on his part of that, another great employee (sorry I didn't catch his name) was showing me some of the super cool long guns, and other James Bond stuff they carry. Even though I was buying an inexpensive little pea shooter, the guys treated me like I was family- and were just super nice and engaging. \\n\\nI ended up picking up a couple other things I was shopping for, and I was shocked at the low, reasonable price. One of the accessories was $18 at Merchant Firearms, but literally $50-60 everywhere else.

The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.\\n\\nOrdered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.\\n\\nMy friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter\/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.\\n\\nRegarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.

ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored.

I am sure they are still working out the kinks since our service was just okay as well but nothing to get \\\"panties in a twist about\\\".  We had a big table and sat outside with the nice heaters, the atmosphere was nice and new inside.  We ordered a side of french fries, fried green beans, and caprese for appetizers.  All of these were just great since the beans and fries came with mayonnaise based sauces that were awesome.  The caprese was different with cherry tomatoes (not my fav), liquified mozzarella, pesto, bread, and oil & vinegar.....although different I thought it was still very good but my wife did not care for it.  We both ordered pizzas, I had the SOP (sausage, caramelized onion, & peppers) and this was a great pizza with lots of great flavor.  The pizza is thin but the end crust is pretty thick and very good.

They literally cooked my hair, and I lost 6 inches of it! I went to a different place on the next day and all the hairstylists were terrified with what happened to my hair and said they had never seen worse job in their lives. It was all damaged and the color was so ugly. I had 6 inches of my hair cut off and I used to have really long, pretty hair. Now my hair is half of its old length because of Mark and Anthony Salon. Not only that, but when I called they said it would cost $60, I ended up paying $150! I asked for a refund and they gave it to me right away, but they can never give me my hair back or all the money I had to spend at the new salon and with all the products I have to use it now to fix what they did. It's going to take about an year for my hair to grow out and not to be damaged anymore. I've never regretted something as much as going to that place.

We walked into a dingy looking restaurant with old, dusty pictures and knick-knacks nailed to the walls and when we were seated, our server was short with us as if they were about to close and she didn't want us there. We all ordered some beer and I opted for the mug to pour mine out of the bottle.

I was served 2 full sized russet potatoes, halved and carved out for the cheese and toppings. There was so much cheese on these potatoes that I literally had to take 3\/4 of it off just to enjoy the potato itself. Also, they were so greasy that even in the short time we were sitting there the grease was piling up on top of the cheese. Did they even strain the bacon bits? I don't think so... Needless to say, I only ate one and lost my appetite. Also to be noted, the silverware was all spotty and looked like they hadn't seen the inside of a dishwasher\/sanitizer in quite some time.\\n\\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because in our rush to get the heck out of there, I left my debit card on the table and the waitress chased us outside to return it.

{"label":0,"text":"Ok. On the advice of a few friends who have been living in Scottsdale for a little while, I decided to take the gf here for her Bday as Mexican is her fav. We're both from Manhattan and are used to getting damn good street tacos and decent Mexican food. So we come here dressed casual chic and apparently the hordes of locals, many of whom I suspect make 30K a year but acted like they make 1 million plus, were dressed in suits and such. Keep in mind, I am in investment banking and my gf is in fashion so when saw this, were were giggling inside. However, this apparently warranted sub-par service as the waitstaff was apparently ignorant and knows not what they do. No surprise here as Scottsdale and most of the area can be accurately described as trailer trash trying really hard to pretend they live in a real city and actually have real jobs. So what we do is what we always do when we try a \\\"hot restaurant\\\" for the first time, we order the one dish that a place like this should never screw up. We ordered tacos. The meat tasted like it was pulled from some frozen TV dinner box, smothered with way too much sauce and overly salted. We decided to end the night right then and there. It was an absolute disgrace. We have had much better tacos at holes in the walls on random streets in NYC. I still don't understand how this place gets such raves and high reviews. Maybe they've never tasted real, authentic Latin\/Mexican food before and this is the only thing they have to benchmark against. Such a sad state of affairs, like so many things in AZ."}

When I started looking for my replacement hotel (used to love the stardust) that was one of my \\\"must haves\\\". A pool & hot tub open all year. It used to be, at least the indoor pool and hot tub were open all year. Now they close it for the winter? It may be winter to Las Vegas natives but many of your guests are from real winter states and 70-75 degrees is plenty warm enough to go for a swim or to sunbathe. Not only does the pool close but they lock the grounds also so you can't even go out and sit in the sun on a lounger or take a walk in the grass. There is no reason I can think of that guests shouldn't be able to go out and sit in the \\\"resort\\\" area by the pool and gardens even if no swimming is allowed.  I'd love to hear the reasoning on that. For a $20 a day so called \\\"resort fee\\\" where's the resort part? Perhaps there should be a discount when the pools, hot tub and grounds are \\\"closed for the winter\\\"? No where in the advertising does it say this. I still love many things about the Trop, especially our casino host, and she is now the main reason I still stay here since to me the pool and grounds are enough to make me move. I haven't conviniced my other half yet but I have opened the conversation. If at least some of these things don't change for the better I will start looking again for a new casino to stay at.  We come several times a year, every year. Please reconsider at least the grounds being locked and allow those of us who live where there is actual winter to enjoy some sun.

They will bring out an ice bucket for you to keep the alcohol cold, but we saw many people who had their own little coolers.  One person I was with said her family brought a cooler on wheels once and the staff was totally fine with it.  It really is very relaxed.\\n\\nMy only complaints about the place were that it was very dark and the decor was lacking, but this restaurant is definitely no frills, no nonsense, and bare bones in order to keep the overhead to a minimum.  Also, the specials on the menu don't have explanations underneath them, so you'll have to listen to the waiter\/waitress when they describe what they are.  Valet parking is pretty necessary for the area and costs $3.  Overall, highly recommended!"}

Their cheeses look like they've been sitting out too long, ditto with the mayo\/mayo-mustard they slather on everything.  The veggies are limp, their pickles frighten me, and I get generally anxious any time I see a Port of Subs worker using the meat slicer.  My sister used to work there and I know what state of mind she used to be in.  I worry someone might lose a thumb. \\n\\nI remember a time when I though Port of Subs was the best sammich place in town.  I wonder if they've just gone downhill or if my tastes have just grown up.

At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well.

{"label":3,"text":"This qualifies as a unique life experience.  You make your OWN wine!!  First you taste whites, reds, white port, ice wine, or anything else you like i.e. riesling,  You decide what you like the best to make a whole batch of 29-30 bottles or 1\/2 batch of 14-15 bottles.  It's $257 for the 1\/2 or $445 for the full.  The cost is less for blush or whites.  Yep, it's hard to narrow it down but I'm going with the Canadian Ice wine called Glacier.

This is basically the \\\"German experience\\\" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.\\n\\nNow, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.\\n\\nMy overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only."}

She made several suggestions for us and we were checked on by her and other employees there. Our drinks were always full so they earned points there.\\n\\nWe ordered miso soup and four sushi rolls (spicy tuna, las vegas, dragon roll and the aloha roll). The miso soup was delicious. It was fresh and full of flavor. The sushi rolls were just ok. I was hoping to walk away with an overall great experience but I just could not get into the rolls.

{"label":2,"text":"Time for an update, and I'm taking away a star for one reason. The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right (the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome), but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently. Portion size. It's $9-$11 dollars for an 8-oz container of food, depending on what you get. Get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you're almost at $40. That's WAY too expensive, no matter how tasty the food is. I know how to make this stuff (technically, although I have problems achieving the flavour) and I know what the ingredients cost. They're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue I have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce. See my Tandoori Village review for more information on this. They need to knock their prices WAY down. I want a take-out meal for two and I want it to be under thirty bucks. When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 (see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise), paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal. Don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either. It ain't Gaylords. Not by a long shot. And Gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself."}

{"label":1,"text":"I visited Yola's Caf\\u00e9 for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  \\n\\nWhen my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the caf\\u00e9.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.\\n\\nWe took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.\\n\\nAfter another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.\\n\\nI finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.\\n\\nOther observations:\\n* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.\\n* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. \\n* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.\\n\\nSo, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."}

You don't tell a customer no on a request like this. You also don't school them on what a back fill is. You simply do what the customer asks and if you want to charge me extra, then fine.\\\" He laughed. No kidding, full on laughed. \\n\\nSo, at the end of the fill he asked to see my feet. Turns out he hadn't put the top coat on. So, he does this but does it in a way where you can see he's all over the place and there is top coat on my toes. \\n\\nI will stick to AZ Tip -n- Toes where my business is appreciated, I'm respected as a customer and my pedicures and fills result in satisfaction! \\n\\nNever again Ahwatukee Nail Spa. Never again."}

{"label":0,"text":"After discussing lunch plans and deciding that we were  long overdue for some Mexican food my girlfriend and I decided to give Cantina 1511 a try.  For starters, the hostess sat us in a relatively unoccupied section and then sat subsequent patrons right next to us.  Although we were seated before the party next to us they got waited on first.  A few minutes later, Tim, our waiter materializes to taken our order.  Tim did take the time to help us navigate the menu and pointed out the main categories which was helpful.  After careful consideration, I ordered the two tacos - a carnes asada and whatever the duck one is called.  My girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas Verde.  Interestingly enough,  the fresh-made-to-order food came out not even 10 minutes after we ordered.  We barely had time to enjoy the greasy and over-salted chips that tasted of old cooking oil and salsa that tasted slightly worse than Old El Paso.  My girlfriend's entree arrives on a skillet with a pile of something under a pool of runny cheese and a another plate with two pitiful looking soft tacos (my entree).  We had both ordered black beans which were void of any real flavor and a complete disappointment (don't get me started on the Charro beans).  A minute or two into digging into her meal, my girlfriend realizes that there's chicken in her enchiladas.  We soon figured out she had been given the wrong entree.  Despite the mistake, the entree tasted like something you might get at a Senior's Center on Mexican food night. Thankfully she is no longer vegetarian.  We quickly flagged down the waiter and explained the mistake.  He said he would check with the kitchen but then showed up a few minutes later with our check.  Needless to say, we'll not be giving this place a second chance."}

Whoaaa now.  $5 roach coach enchiladas could stand up to theirs.  $9 chips and guacamole?? It was good but not $9 good!  I think this place has a complex... You can put cloth napkins and fancy paper menus on the table but in the end you're still a mainstream Mexican restaurant with TONS of competition... CHEAP competition that's just as good.  I won't go back just because of the price unfortunately..."}

I mentioned it to very friendly lady that delivered my food and she promptly got it for me.\\n\\nI ordered a green meat, a red meat and a chicken taco.  All three tacos came individually wrapped in foil and came in a brown paper bag.  It also came with both green and red sauces.  All three came with soft flour tortilla wrappings.

The tables also had El Pato Sauce and another hot sauce for your pleasure, although I am not sure they keep them refrigerated?\\n\\nThe flavor, temperature, and the taste of the meat tacos were fine.  I was surprised to find beans in all 3 tacos, but they added nice texture and flavor.\\n\\nThe green and red meat tacos were pretty good, but did not stand out as something that I would crave on a Saturday night after a few brews.

{"label":2,"text":"Glitz and glamour it isn't, but for a fair deal a one bedroom suite with a living room, pull out couch, and kitchenette right on the strip, this is your place. \\nThey describe it as \\\"snuggled away\\\" next to the Cosmo, I say it's practically hidden. This tiny, family owned spot is easy to miss but once you find it, you realize it's a pretty nice location; Easy walking distance to everything. It really has to be one of the best values if you have a big group as I did for a bachelorette party or you are counting your pennies and still want the popular location.\\nThe rooms aren't ugly or smelly and the other guests seem more or less respectable, but it's definitely bare bones place: tacky, tiny onsite pool, no casino, and no view (don't let that main picture fool you- my room looked at the service car driveway, not the Bellagio Fountains). This is truly just a place to sleep, eat left-overs in the morning, and pre-drink. We had a group of 8 that stayed in two different rooms and everyone had a place to crash at night and we stored our food and treats in the fridges so it worked. The beds and bathroom are just ok, nothing amazing but enough room for everyone. The beds weren't backbreaking but not exactly comfy. But I suppose if you are coming to the Vegas strip to hang out in your room, you are doing it wrong. \\nOne nice feature - if you can find it-  is an elevator that connects The Jockey Club with the Cosmo Casino. It's hard to find in both buildings though. The elevator from the Jockey Club to the Cosmo lets you out on a weird floor (no grand entrance, sorry) but it is a convenient way to get next door once you figure it out. Guests of the Jockey Club can use one of the Cosmo pool's, free of charge, as well. We spent an afternoon at the pool and it was pleasant enough but ended up going to one of the other hotel's pools for a change of pace. \\nI say 5 stars for low price and value you get for the suite size, 5 stars for location, 1 star for name recognition- I can't tell you how many blank stares we got when we said where we were staying, 2 stars for amenities because of the lack of a view, lack of a restaurant in the hotel, the lack of an onsite pool, and the basic room d\\u00e9cor.

I always play a good mix rap, rock, country and of course some good ole Mexican music ie Selena and Elvis Crespo. Nothing crazy like I said a good mix of music and no one has ever complained. Well today I played a nice popular Selena song and about halfway in the owner Ed walks over to me (obviously the only Hispanic customer there) and asks me if I had picked this song. Awkward I go well yes I did why is there a problem. Ed tells me well I just wanted to make sure someone paid for this and it is not a random song, usually we skip music like this. As my jaw drops I ask why. Well Mr. Donald Sterling tells me well it's early in the morning and I don't want people to get uncomfortable  it's almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of F bombs no one wants to hear that. Whoa whoa whoa it's an open juke box and if you don't want certain types of music played then block it. Simple as that. So I tell him to give me my money back and he can skip the song. Ed tells me no that's ok he will let me play my song this time. And I could already see who had complained as an older woman and her maybe mother or friend had a sour look on their face as they were staring at me. Well my response to all of that was hello you are at a bar before noon and there are no listed guidelines on what music to play. So I will take my money somewhere else where my brownness will not offend anyone. Sorry Ed you lost a really loyal customer over two older women and their fear of a little diversity."}

{"label":3,"text":"This place has changed our lives. Seriously! \\nMy wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. \\nThen, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!\\nThe food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!"}

Not fantastic, just good. The sweet potato fritters were a joke. When something is that boring and uninspired it really needs to come with something like, oh...I dunno...25 dipping sauces. I'm sure I've seen deep fried boring remedied by flavored lard in the past. Get on the ball Grind. \\n\\nThe service was okay. The whisky tango flavored waitstaff, all brunette with a similar 'look'  was interesting. Like if you took all of the servers at The Vig and secretly replaced them with Famous Sams waitresses; that kind of interesting. \\n\\nThe beer and wine selection was clearly lacking and again, uninspired. I suppose the focus is supposed to be on the specialty drinks which actually seemed well thought out though none seemed to appeal to me in the moment.

Some sort of club sandwich, not a far cry from a sandwich I would typically order, so I knew I would like this type of meal.\\n\\nWhen the food came, the sandwich was extremely disappointing. The bread was so DRY. Not fresh or springy or anything good, it was dry and crumbly. I took about three bites, discovered that the rest of the ingredients followed suit with being disappointing. \\n\\nSo, I brought it back up to the counter, and told the same woman who had taken my order that I did not like the food, that it was dry, and that I wanted to take it back. She was sweet and smart and called over another woman, Im guessing a supervisor or a manager, and explained the situation. This supervisor woman clarified that I \\\"just didn't like it\\\" and told me that they would not be replacing my meal with something else. I said fine and just asked for a refund, which she unhappily gave me.\\n\\nThe thing that irks me is that they weren't willing to give me something else. So, I leave this place hungry and with a bad food experience. What incentive does this give me to go back? From the experience I had, I didn't like the food or the customer service. Not to mention, the sandwich alone cost 8 bucks. If I can go to Sprouts and get a bomb ass sandwich for $3.50, I want an 8 dollar sandwich to blow my socks off, not be a total disappointment."}

She's always been a hard worker and I can see how much effort she has put into her restaurant venture. The restaurant was very clean and neat, and Esther was a very gracious hostess to all the customers. I had the pepper soup, which comes with a little dish of habanero pepper puree if you want to make it spicy. Watch out! Only use a tiny bit because it's really hot. Then I had a Caribbean meat pie. It was really good--spicy and savory. Then the yassa chicken. The chicken itself was deliciously flavored, and then topped with with olives, onions, and bell pepper sauteed in a mustard sauce, then served with rice. It was very good! I want to come again and try some of the other dishes. I highly recommend this place! Esther is a sweet lady and she takes good care of her customers. I wish her the best of luck with her new restaurant."}
{"label":3,"text":"I picked this place for its pools. Overall everything was well but I think staying here once will be enough for us. The reason? There were WAY too many lifeguards. The problem with this is you can't dive, you can't run or walk along the wave action pool, you can't stand by the wave to get hit in the face with a wave, which I actually wanted, you can't take a raft to the lazy river. FFS! Tubes only in the lazy river and good luck finding a chair after noon because you probably won't. The pools also close at 7pm so no sexy time in the jacuzzi late night. We opted out on the cabanas but found a couple of chairs our first and 3rd day but our 2nd day, we had to lay on the sand. If you only want a jacuzzi minus the kids, I suggest you walk to the south lagoon for the jacuzzi hot tub there. You can relax there if you don't have kids. Anyways, this place still gets a 4 star from me. Safety is important and they can't help the crowds. It's a very fun resort and another wonderful casino floor plan from this company."}

{"label":2,"text":"This was a typical resort restaurant the food was fairly ambitious and the food was pricey. I had the chicken because almost any other entree was really pricey, and almost solidly steak. Never the less the food was pretty good and the service was great. Unfortunately the table next to us lit up and then it was pretty smokey, but we were already done, and we chose to sit outside so that I don't blame them for at all. In the end it was a little too pricey for what your gonna get, some good food but also it was the resort and I wouldn't expect anything different. I probably won't be back, our server was really nice though that's the only reason I feel bad about giving this place 3 stars. Other than that it was all around ok."}
{"label":4,"text":"When is anyone ever compelled to write a review about a parking lot?? Well, this one really sets a new standard. A once dreaded experience of searching for secure parking and getting to the airport on time has been turned into an experience where the normal hassles are eliminated. \\n\\nThey offer covered parking. Spaces are not crammed together. Shuttle driver helps you with your bags immediately and pulls up right when you park (no wasted time - perfect for a commuter who is normally cutting it close to get to the gate). \\n\\nThe icing on the cake is really the Paradise cookie voucher - a sweet treat to top off the experience. Again, when do you get rewarded with a free cookie just for doing something as mundane as parking your car?"}
{"label":1,"text":"This place is big. There's bowling, pool, a restaurant with okay food, and games, most of which are played for tickets. There are three major knocks on this place in my opinion. First, it's really not that kid friendly, as it's open on two ends and there's nothin preventing someone from walking out with a kid. I always stress safety when we go but parents really need to stay in top of their kids, which can be difficult if you have more than one child. \\n\\nSecondly, it lacks a food selection of traditional arcade games. Most games are extremely violent or involve tickets, neither of which are appropriate for kids of some ages. \\n\\nOn another note, the games that are played for tickets are really an introduction to gambling, i.e. pay money to play a game of chance in hopes of winning tickets or a prize. I always steer the young ones away from playing games solely in the hope of winning tickets. I stress hat they should play a game that will be fun regardless of whether it involves tickets.\\n\\nIn summation, true kids love the place but I'm not a big fan."}
{"label":1,"text":"I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary."}
{"label":3,"text":"This is a cute place for sandwiches, breads and treats. The customer service is helpful and they give you a taste of one of the breads upon coming into the shop. \\nThey answer questions and are knowledgeable.\\nThey have a point system for a free loaf of bread that they enter in the computer so be sure to give them your information. We got monkey bread and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. They unfortunately didn't have any snickerdoodle ready, and the oatmeal wasn't a hit. The monkey bread however is great with lots gooey cinnamon and easy to pull apart. We got a taste of pumpkin chocolate chip which was good if you like pumpkin and they give a full slice of bread. \\nNot sure if different locations have different breads but they serve different breads different days of the week and the blueberry streusel we had at another location isn't available here."}

Located in a strip mall, just look for the huge \\\"Panda bandit\\\" cartoons on the window.\\n\\nChoose your \\\"meat\\\" -- the popular items like \\\"Jade Chicken\\\" is essentially a spicy version of orange chicken. Emerald chicken, a runner up, is boiled chicken with a minced ginger, scallions oil based sauce -- which is better with rice than in a tortilla since it's not as salty.\\n\\nThen, throw that into a burrito, taco, or have it with rice and beans \\\"remix.\\\" The beans have been flavored with hoisin or oyster sauce to give it a sweet, umami tang. There's also \\\"jerk fried rice\\\" which is... rich, spicy and a great contrast to the meat dish. \\n\\nFinishes with a large snickerdoodle cookie, which was a little out of place, but hey, cookies!\\n\\nCafeteria style seating, order and sit down and they'll bring the food to you. At 8-10 bucks per meal, it's quite a steal, and a must try if you find yourself in Arizona."}

I would still order again b\/c the flavor was good and it was filling. I just know for next time (for at least that item) to ask for extra hummus.

{"label":1,"text":"Dear Lowes: Thank you for selling my fiancee & I a really nice washer and dryer, an extended warranty that at $175 for both units is 75% cheaper than what Sears would charge for their warranties, and for hooking us up with the stainless steel hoses, dryer hose, and the gas line kit we needed. \\n\\nOh and after dropping all that coin we got promised \\\"Next Day Delivery!\\\". It's on huge banners in your store, it's so easy to read. It's not so easy to do!\\n\\nWell our washer and dryer was bought on Friday and delivery was set for Saturday. Saturday arrives...10 am, Noon, 2 pm...no Lowes truck to be seen or heard of. So we call the store, get shuffled around and then get told your order didn't even get on the truck. Nice...we get a manager apologizing profusely and she says we'll schedule you for the first thing Sunday morning. This is marginally acceptable until late Saturday we get a call: Your delivery is now set for 1-3 pm or basically the last deliveries of the day! WTH? So we call back...nobody has heard of the manager we spoke to, and our order can't be found either. And that promise of an early morning delivery evaporated like rain in Vegas does. \\n\\nSo here I sit, trying to potty train a 3 year old boy. If you've never had kids let me tell you this is an experience. A lack of control experience. As in if it's in front of him chances are he thinks it's cool to spray it. And while it's all part of the wonderful experience of being a parent, it's a lot easier to manage if cleanup is easy. And not having a washer and dryer that you went out and paid for makes it frustrating. And when I get frustrated because someone promises something in large blue and white print banners and then makes similar verbal promises and yet I sit here with empty washer and dryer connections waiting for relief...well you can see why this Yelp review got posted. \\n\\n2 Stars: #1 is because it's Lowes which I still like, Star #2 is because they didn't rip me off on extended warranties like Sears wanted to do. I wrote a review for Sears Outlet to rant about that experience! If they get my stuff delivered I'll bump them up. But for now 2 Stars is all they get. \\n\\n(Edit #1: Their manager called, admitted he screwed up the delivery. I'm supposed to have my stuff within the hour.

Not much flavor at all - more of just a vehicle for the toppings.  As for the specific pies:\\n-Margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall I would call this a pretty average Margherita pizza\\n-Proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the Proscuitto and Fromage blanc worked perfectly together.  With a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.\\n-Lamb Chorizo - a very nice pie overall - enjoyed the chorizo, and the toppings all worked well together. \\n\\nService was excellent."}

The waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and I could share.  It was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  It actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  I order the duck breast, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is that the duck was cut VERY thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  It was good, but not over the top amazing.  We were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert---OMG AMAZING!  It definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. The service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  I would recommend this place, BUT I would not come here again.

He said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so I needed to purchase a new tire. Then he handed me an invoice for almost $300 for one new tire. \\n\\nI explained to him that I did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me? I did not authorize such work in the service agreement I signed. I have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent. I explained to him that Findlay's actions were not authorized and that I am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me. His response was that if I didn't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way. I asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check.\\n\\nAbout 30 minutes later he came back and guess what.....all of a sudden the story changed. Seems the service guy did NOT take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car. Without even getting into how much of a SCAM this is, I told him the tire was not flat, or even low, when I brought it in so I don't understand why the guy had to \\\"pump it up\\\". He had no answer for me.  \\n\\nI fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that I HAD to buy a new tire. Had I not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed, they tried to fix it but after it was out they couldn't, I would have been forced to spend $300 on a new tire for THEIR unauthorized work. To further my belief that this I a total scam, only after I refused to blindly pay $300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had NOT done the work they originally claimed to have done.\\n\\nI don't know if it was because I was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line, or if this is status quo for Findlay but either way it is so wrong.\\n\\nI got my car and I left.  At that moment they lost me as customer and forever lost my recommendation."}

{"label":3,"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for some time now. My most recent visit impressed me so much that I couldn't let more time pass by. I went when it first opened, I had been anxiously waiting for it since I had tried Megan Romano's desserts at Aureole. \\n\\nWe went there for breakfast wanting to try a bunch of things, chose a breakfast sandwich and a quiche as well as a blackberry scone and gelato. The space is decorated really nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into the details. Everybody that works there is really nice too. Anywho, the breakfast items and pastry were ok, nothing out of this world. I thought the scone was kind of dry in fact. But the gelato was OUT OF THIS WORLD! We tried grapefruit and strawberry and they were incredible, the taste was so pure! It was like taking a bite out of the freshest fruit out there!\\n\\nOn my most recent visit I went in the evening (they are open til 7 so that's a major plus) for the sole purpose of getting my husband a treat. I ended up getting some bon bons, truffles, chocolate-covered graham crackers and oreos. In theory, they were all for my husband but since I purchased two of each, I decided when I got home to try one. OMG! I ended up trying one of each and let me tell you, they were all FANTASTIC! This is some seriously good chocolate folks. It is on the pricey side, 1.50-2 dollars a piece but well worth it. I think if they were cheaper I would end up buying 20 pieces and eating them all by myself! So tis way, you feel like it's a treat to eat and you don't devour it. You are able to savor each bite. Sheer bliss."}

The convenience factor (buying a quick to-go meal in the grocery store) is the biggest draw of this establishment.\\n\\nCafeteria-style serving, the food is generally not very hot, the portions are small for an extremely high price ($8+ for a 3-item entree consists of a small scoop of each of your entrees and not that much rice, either), and the staff is often rude. If you question the portion size, they'll add a little more and say something in another language to whoever's in the back that usually elicits laughter. I don't mind people communicating in their preferred language, but the timing and the laughter makes me uncomfortable.\\n\\nI used to be a big fan of this place, until the pricing went up and the portions went down - along with the service. They charge extra for shrimp or BBQ pork ($1.50 upcharge why? - the items aren't that special). The worst part was that the next day the leftovers made me incredibly sick (after being stored in the fridge and reheated properly) which did not happen on previous trips. \\n\\nSkip Rice Garden even if you're in Bashas' and hungry - there's a few other places in the strip mall and a freezer section in the grocery store. They're not open very late, the food is likely to not be hot enough anyway, and the price does not reflect the quality."}
{"label":0,"text":"My wife and I brought our animals here for over 10 years, even after moving to Stallings, we would still drive all that way. Recently after our oldest rescue passed away, we decided to find a new vet mostly because we had noticed that ever since becoming a \\\"VCA\\\" animal hospital, the prices have sky-rocketed, and the service has dropped significantly. \\n\\nWhen I say the prices are ridiculous, they are literally double for most basic procedures that you can get done at any vet office. If the prices are going to be that high, I would expect the service to match what I am paying, and that is certainly not the case. We always felt pressured into very high priced procedures, that when we turned down because of price, were snubbed off and looked down upon by the Dr and\/or Tech.  That does not stand true for everyone working in the office, but the great majority. \\n\\nI can truly say I believe this office cares more about money than they do about any living being, animal or human. \\n\\nTo top it off, and this is what pushed me to finally write this review, is a few days ago I got an advertisement for dog teeth care in the mail from VCA.

Sorry that was sent from our corporate office in California, must have been done before our records updated.   I don't want your excuse of corporate sending something, when we started coming here there was no \\\"corporate\\\" in California.\\n\\nAll VCA cares about, yes they are known to me now as just VCA, the Stoney Creek we went to does not exist anymore,  is the money.\\n\\n Find a consistent vet, one who knows your animals, and is not trying to rip your wallet out of your pocket the entire visit."}

The sushi is very simple and lacking in flavor. I know they switch up the selection but both times the selection was all very basic rolls (california, tuna, tempura, etc) and missing some of the more vibrant rolls like Dragon, Las Vegas, Soft-Shell Crab, things like that. \\nMy good friend really loves this place, so I know sushi tastes can be very differed; however I felt they were too basic and would rather spend a little more money for big-flavored rolls over $1 to $4 unimpressive rolls."}
{"label":3,"text":"A girlfriend and I came in for lunch on Saturday to take advantage of the prix fixe menu they offered in support of Las Vegas Restaurant Week. \\n\\nI loved the seating\/reservations coordinator downstairs. She checked my name in the computer, confirmed to the restaurant upstairs that I was in the building, and led us into the elevator. It was, at once, very posh and attentive, but cool and casual and welcoming. Definitely a good start.\\n\\nThe elevator opens up to the kitchen. A great touch; I love to see the kitchen and have a sense of what is going on with my food! Walk to the right and you enter into the bar area and see the hostess desk. You also see that there really isn't a bad seat in the place. It is tiered so as to offer, as much as possible, a view to every diner. Great idea. The decor is upscale and comfortable, simple and elegant without putting off the casual diner.\\n\\nWe were seated at an intimate two-person table on the window, facing the Bellagio and fountains. C'est parfait! Tres jolie! We loved the show against a somewhat dreary day in Las Vegas; the lights lit up the water and made the view (and by proxy the ambiance of the restaurant) that much more beautiful.\\n\\nService was spectacular. Everything was timed perfectly, from the amuse to the apps to the entrees to desserts. Wine service was expedient and attentive. Everything was explained well, if not a little too rehearsed; we heard the same spiel over and over, almost verbatim, to tables around us. Hint: change it up a bit, add some personality and personability to it! Still, friendly, capable, and humorous when appropriate, everyone was on their game.\\n\\nMmmmm, food. This *is* a restaurant, after all.\\n\\nDrinks: We opted for wine by the glass, but they did have some yum-sounding signature cocktails... for about $18 a piece. Just not worth it to me... I can have three glasses of wine to your one cocktail and be happier for it. Others around us were loving their drinks, and I see value in that on occasion, but it was something we skipped... this time.\\n\\nAmuse: a light but flavor-FULL mushroom flan with a small piece of mushroom on top. Savory goodness in less than a bite and one of the best fungi preparations I have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.\\n\\nApps: The foie gras (not on the LVRW menu, but ordered as an extra) was absolutely phenomenal. Served cold, it was a large, thick slice straight off the liver. Nothing formed or cubed or otherwise manipulated, it was marbled by veins and perfect. As if that's not amazing enough, it was wrapped in duck prosciutto. Yeah, drool-worthy.\\n\\nThe spinach and grueyere streudel was good. I hoped for more cheese, and I found the crust to be a bit too hard. That said, the flavors were solid and the spinach was fresh. Not a bad dish.\\n\\nEntree: The flank steak had a great flavor and the cabernet jus was delicious. But there was something about how it was cut... almost against the grain? Sadly, it was also a little tough. We ordered them medium rare (I even added \\\"more on the rare side\\\") and they were closer, I think, to medium. Great flavors, but a little lost on execution.\\n\\nDessert: The peach tartin was fantastic. The pastry was light and crisp, the peaches were fresh, sweet and tender, and the basil ice cream with piece of crispy basil was a lovely, sweet and savory complement to the rest of the dish. Really, really done well.\\n\\nI never felt rushed, the meal was very good and the prices were good. Aside from the prix fixe decision we made, the foie gras was only $20 (and compared to other places I have been lately, that's an amazing deal for what they offer. Definitely a fave!). With 2 glasses of wine each and all of the above, it was only $65 or so each before a tip. Very much worth the visit!\\n\\nFor next time... I see wine and foie gras and dessert at the bar. Casual yet still surrounded by the intimate elegance... and with a fabulous view."}
{"label":2,"text":"If you are a bride and groom to be, then you must admit that it's a jungle out there for wedding venues, all of them heading towards traditional virtues trying to understanding what it is the bridal party wants; then caters to their needs, be it for venue, transport, dress, food or otherwise?\\n\\nThe Quayside is conveniently situated almost right on Musselburgh beach, with a picturesque harbour opposite, small boats tied up...you get the picture, on sunny weekends or during festivals is packed with some type of private function. But with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, I felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early June.\\n\\nThe party I was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local Haddington newspaper. Well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. So thanks to the Courier as the organiser!\\n\\nThe decor inside the Quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. Another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2. There is a lift for people that don't fancy or can't do the walk, but it's not that quick!\\n\\nWith adequate parking to the rear and side of the venue overlooking the harbour, it really pays to park as close to the venue as possible, especially as it rained heavily on the day in question, so it kind of ruined those precious wedding photos!\\n\\nWedding food was faultless but was it really that price(\\u00a375each according to the Bride's father), but we did get champs upon reception. Red and White wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). With all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when I requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!\\n\\nFood booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. To any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. To make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. With reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.\\n\\nSpeaking of food, Quayside renamed their restaurant as the \\\"World Buffet\\\",(does exactly as is says). The name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. But with many foods available (and I did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit. But I ask you, after unlimited buffet food not many peeps will have room for fruit anyhow?\\n\\nRequiring another visit to experience since I was there for a wedding so couldn't appreciate this mass buffet experience. My mission should I choose to accept it is to find out, but if  the wedding food was anything to go by, they'll probably be ok???\\n\\nWorld Banq, musselburgh - One place many cuisines, all for \\u00a38.50, you try you decide?"}

We started with a very fresh salad and two types of potato salad which were good.  The ribs we had were superb, they had a great taste, moist and meaty and fell off the bone.  They were not fatty like you get at most places.  The chicken was juicy.  We had chicken and turkey sausages that were good.  I always check the bathrooms and this one was nice and clean.  That says a lot about the place and how the owners take care of it.  We were very happy and will come again."}

We will definitely go back again whenever we get a chance."}

{"label":3,"text":"I give this place 4 stars because of the staff's attentiveness and the degree of customer service they demonstrated at our last visit. There were two people at the register. I'll call them guy 1 and guy 2. Guy 1 was taking our order. When we ordered I asked if they had some sort of juice for our toddler. I saw guy 2 whisper something to guy 1. I didn't think anything of it. Guy 1 said they have milk, and because my toddler somehow hates milk this week I said it's ok, no drink for her. Then they told us they can get apple juice. So we ordered apple juice. It seemed like they had to get the apple juice from somewhere because it was delivered to our table. I'm very pleased, they didn't have to do this, but I can see that they try their best to satisfy the customers. I don't think the $1 I paid for the apple juice is worth them getting it from somewhere, but it goes without saying that we really appreciated it.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, I really like the thin crusted pizza, almost like a flatbread, so I don't feel like I'm 10 pounds heavier by the time I'm done. We also ordered a small bowl of pasta with meatballs, it could've used a bit more flavor and seasoning. But overall, very pleased with this experience (third time at this location)."}

The sweet potato fries, onion strings, and the garlic chips are great.  The burgers are in the $10 to $14 dollar range.  But they are very large one half of pound burgers.

{"label":0,"text":"US Today needs to have its head examined. Had a brunch buffet for $25 which featured really, compared to Bellagio and the superb Cosmopolitan, very few choices. Dry brisket and sausages. Seafood bar without seafood. Had a small cup which had a handful of gamey shrimp and crab pieces in it. Needed a big mug of green tea to wipe my mouth clean after that. Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed. Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple. Imagine that... and they didn't even have to cook it at the hotel. Forget the hype and avoid this culinary waste space."}

This is where my review goes south.

It's almost always soaking wet because of the same issue. Parents changing their wet kids and not cleaning up after themselves.\\n\\nIf you need a really great, clean changing area??

I was parked in a spot labeled \\\"Visitor\\\".  If this many cars are getting towed everyday, that says something about their communication about parking there. \\n\\nThis place only takes cash (so they can probably pay a chunk to whoever else is part of the parking scam at Firefly..) and they charge $7 ATM fee.  \\n\\nMy license was in my car, in my purse, and they wont let you go to the lot to get it, someone brings it out to you. \\n\\nThe manager at this place told me Firefly has been doing this for months.

Very small place, but definitely embraces the local arts scene with lots of art inside as well as lit up empty liquor and wine bottles on the wall.  Bar Maximus is attached as well for more space and lively atmosphere.  Food is very eclectic.  I had a pizza, but not just any pizza.  Sausage, cheddar cheese, and jelly (yes, jelly).  Unusual?  You bet.  Tasty?  Very.  The waitress was very friendly and the owner also came by to check on us.  My one disappointment was the beer and wine list.  It was pretty limited in variety.  Might be an area for improvement.  That said, very happy to have this neighborhood hangout spot.  Would gladly take friends here."}
{"label":3,"text":"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  \\n\\nThe salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  \\n\\nI believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. \\n\\nThe rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  \\n\\nThe decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  \\n\\nService wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."}

{"label":1,"text":"When my sister-in-law told me there was a resale kids shop in Las Vegas, I organized a bunch of stuff and hauled it in the next day. I think that they give about 10-15% of their sale price. Here is an example: I sold them my son's $50 Lucky Brand Jeans. They'll sell them for $12 or so which means I'll get $1.20 for those perfect condition jeans. \\n\\nI went in there with tons of jeans, jackets, shirts (mostly all of which were baby gap), a stroller, rainforest play gym, and a luxe boppy. This was easily $600 worth of stuff and when I saw that they bought everything, I expected quite a bit of money. Intead, I got $41. \\n\\nI later went back there to sell small toys because toys probably wouldn't sell for much at a yardsale or on eBay anyway, but I saw the $60 play gym I sold them selling for $25 which means I got $2.50 for it. There was also the same playgym there missing various pieces and filthy selling for $20 which means I only got paid $0.50 more. I will definitely be selling my stuff on eBay and Craigslist and bringing in the rejects to this store. \\n\\nShopping here on the other hand is a bargain. Some of their stuff is still new including robeez shoes ($40 at Daggermans) selling for $10. I will probably come here to buy a new pair of robeez and maybe some toys for the kiddos."}
{"label":3,"text":"I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.\\n\\nThere's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.\\n\\nThis location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.\\n\\nIf you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try."}

The staples on the daily menu are fantastic - their burgers are some of Madison's very best, and the specials, oh, the specials!  You have to go early because people are onto this place and they sell out fast.  It's worth the effort to get there, and it's worth the wait, even if it's crowded (it often is).  Bring cash or your ATM card.\\n\\nThe beer list rivals the food menu, with often-rotating beers including some that aren't seen often.  It's definitely one of the best tap lineups in town, and this is a beer town.  \\n\\nAlchemy is a very casual, unassuming tavern that doesn't necessarily tip you off to what awaits you when you order, and that's part of what makes it such a cool place.  \\n\\nThis is a somewhat short review but that shouldn't imply there's not a lot to say about Alchemy, because I could go on and on.

{"label":0,"text":"Don't waste your time of money.\\n\\nI came in to Vegas for a friend's wedding. I had planned on getting a leg and Brazilian wax before I left but my normal aesthetician had a family emergency come up and had to cancel. \\n\\nI figured that once I got to Vegas I could hit up the spa and get it taken care of without trying to figure out how to get to some of the places off the strip. I was staying at the Luxor and though the price was about double what I'd usually pay I went ahead and booked the appointment. \\n\\nFirst I was surprised to know that they booked both full leg and Brazilians for 50minutes each! Damn Gina! In 2 hours my normal girl can wax me from head to toe and leave me looking smooth as a baby! To make matters worse, the girl actually took closer to 2 1\/2 hours. I know I walked in looking like Sasquatch, but I've never had a wax take so long. She was incredibly nice, and made me feel comfortable which I consider really important when someone is all up in my hooha. \\n\\nStrike two occurred when I noticed  (though not until the end of the service) that the woman double dipped. WTF? I can't believe that any reputable spa would allow that. \\n\\nWhen she was finished I had to rush to leave because I was meeting friends and was running a bit late. So the next morning color me disappointed when I noticed several spots on my knees and the back of my thighs where patches of long hair was left. This wasn't the new growth patches that can be difficult to remove, these were spots that were completely overlooked. I also noticed a thumbprint bruise on my knee and also some smaller bruises on my pubic area. \\n\\nWhen I called to talk to a manager she stated that I needed to file a report with security. I literally had my entire weekend booked from start to finish so there wasn't really time for that. Instead I sent her pictures of the bruising on my knee. She asked what I would like for her to do about  and I said that I'd like to get my money back. She gave me half back.\\n\\nSo I ended up spending $90 instead of $180. Better but not great.\\n\\nEspecially when you consider that the price for both services were $150 and the extra $30 was mandatory gratuity. I don't understand why they didn't just increase their pricing if they're going to mandate gratuity.\\n\\nDefinitely don't recommend this place, at least not for waxing services."}

The bartended approached us pretty quickly but after that it went down hill.  Sat there with empty glasses a couple of times and just luckily caught the bartenders eye to wave him down to our end of the bar.  He seemed more interested in working the service bar.  So we started out with crab cakes and lettuce wraps. Crab cakes were terrible.  Had no taste what so ever.  The frozen ones I bought at BJ's were definately better.  The chicken wraps had some flavor but still nothing exciting.  My friend got the scallops which he said were good and I got the Miso Cod with peaches and fried rice.  Peaches were disgusting. Tasted like canned peaches that had been soaking for several hours in some marinade. The fish was okay I guess, but it was just cod.  Like I said, I think the main reason Zink might continue to exist is only because of people not wanting to wait hours to eat at Cowfish."}

You check out your own book and return it through a conveyor belt system that require no human interactions. The second floor holds a vast majority of the library collection. I came here to study for my MCAT and it is a really nice place to get a lot work done. The interior of the library is really well designed.

{"label":2,"text":"Part of the Lettuce Entertain You group of restaurants, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba started out in Chicago, then opened a branch in Las Vegas.  It specializes in tapas.  Originally intended as bar snacks, the term now refers to small portions of food (at least in the United States).  Choose a few and you have a meal; choose a bunch and you have a meal for a group of friends.\\n\\nIn addition to tapas, the menu offers paella and a few other items, but tapas are the stars. There are more than 50 choices, plus another dozen desserts.  Cold tapas include serrano ham, olives and chicken salad; hot tapas include octopus, empanadas and roast dates with bacon.\\n\\nThe inside dining areas are dark: dark stained wood flooring, dark wood tables, moderate lighting.  Loud guitar music plays; a Flamenco version of \\\"California Dreamin'\\\" was one of the more unusual selections.  The outside area, facing the strip, seemed much more inviting, but it was too hot outside for me.  Service was prompt; I ordered tapas one at a time, and they arrived pretty quickly.\\n\\nAt Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, tapas have been supersized.  A typical dish could serve as a small appetizer for four people, or as an hors d'oeuvre for even more people.  I was hard pressed to finish just three plates.  Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego cheese also included triangles of toasted bread with chopped tomato on top.  Both the cheese and meats were thinly sliced, and very strongly flavored.  A winner.  It wasn't finger food, definitely requiring a knife and fork, but was big enough that it would best be split several ways.\\n\\nRoast dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette was an interesting dish.  Small dates (or perhaps halves of large dates) were wrapped in bacon, then grilled until the bacon was crispy and the dates were very chewy.  A small amount of vinaigrette was poured on top.  It was an unusual combination of sweet, salty, sour and fatty tastes.\\n\\nGrilled squid in olive oil and garlic consisted of large pieces of squid (both body and tentacles) sauted in olive oil.  Barely cooked through, the squid was still tender.  It was a little oily, but I liked it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe food was OK, but as a solo diner I didn't really enjoy myself.  The supposedly tapa sized portions are actually quite large, and not conducive to ordering many dishes if one is dining alone.  I think it would be more fun with a group, at one of the outdoor tables."}
{"label":1,"text":"Mediocre review for a mediocre meal. Womp Womp Womp\\n\\nAlright its not all bad. The restaurant is quite large, its always buzzing with happy families and their menu is extensive. My 3 stars are for very slow service and a meal lacking any flavor. I ordered the \\\"tri-athlete\\\" breakfast: egg white veggie omelet (usually with salsa on top), side of cottage cheese and a toasted english muffin. Despite what some people may think, there is no reason why healthy meals can't be packed with flavor. Yes, even without the bacon (gasp!).\\n\\nThe omelet was cooked decently but it didn't have any seasoning to it. Basically I struggle to rave about because I can replicate and exceed it at home. Now, my friends enjoyed their breakfast- especially the pumpkin pancakes (a specialty during the Fall only). Our server took enough time to come and refill coffee and take our orders that we often had to hunt her down so we could finish our breakfast in under 2 hours. \\n\\nI'm sorry this review lacks wittiness, charm or good writing. Its mediocre, kinda like First Watch. Yikes."}
{"label":4,"text":"I can't say enough about how much I love this studio. I gave the studio a try on the insistence of one of my friends who has been practicing there for a while. We tried an initial class together and the rest is history- I'm hooked! \\n\\nThere are so many things about the studio that I love. The location is perfect in Plaza Midwood and there is ample parking. Upon walking in, there is always a friendly face to greet you at the door. Sometimes there is even a puppy face to greet you which is even better. :-) The check in process is quick and easy with a scanable key chain card. There are cubby holes to put your stuff into and plenty of areas to change, grab water and get ready. \\n\\nThe hot yoga studio (A) is huge and beautiful! Hardwood floors and red brick walls stretching up to high ceilings. The decorations are fun and tasteful and fit with the vibe of the studio. There are parking spots for mats not uncomfortably close to your neighboring mat. There are no mirrors on the walls as the instructors coach you through looking at your body and feeling your way through a pose as opposed to focusing on how it looks. \\n\\nWhen the class is ready to begin the instructor introduces themselves and gets you started in your first pose. The instructors speak through the class re-inforcing the Baptiste yoga principles through the practice and always add so much to think about (and often laugh about) through the practice. After a short warm up (which you might be surprised is just a warm up) they start the class with an \\\"Om\\\". This was new to me and I really wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, so I didn't do it the first few classes which wasn't an issue at all. Everyone is focused on their own practice so you're very free to go where you want to in your practice. Next the flow sequence begins. It's challenging, hot and rewarding. Coming from a studio that heated their room to 105-110 degrees, I love the temps being between 95-100. Hot enough to warm up the muscles and get a good sweat going, but not so hot that it's distracting. \\n\\nEach class is different. Different instructors bring a different experience to each class. Surprisingly I found that I enjoy the 90 minute classes the most and there are certain instructors that I will happily rearrange my schedule to make their class. (Daniel, David, Sally, Liz....) Each class offers a wide variety of options for your practice from modifications to poses to moving into advanced poses. Where you bring your practice is up to you and there is no judgement regardless of what you decide! Sometimes I'll move into side crow from chair twist, other times I'll happily sit in chair twist and regardless of what I do I feel great about it. \\n\\nThe instructors are encouraging and never fail to challenge you to push your limits. They emphasize matching breath with movement and proper pose aligment. They and the assistants are happy to come over and help you in any pose. Oh the assistants- one of the best things about Y1! Each of the assistant in class (from one to three!) is specially trained to come around and assist you in your poses. Each assist feels like a mini-massage and is just wonderful- not to mention helpful to find your place in a pose. :-) \\n\\nEnding the practice with Savasana the lights are turned down, the fans turned on and a cold lavendar washcloth set at the top of your mat to place on your face (or whereever you like) to assist with cooling you down. \\n\\nI've taken the 60minute, 90 minute and deep stretch classes and enjoyed all of them. I'm very excited to start taking the Wednesday night foundational classes to become more acquainted with proper pose alignment. They also offer fantastic workshops- seems to be every weekend and other group activities. I love their committment to the community and local charities. \\n\\nCan't think of anything negative to say! (Unless you talk to me the days that I'm so sore I can barely move- but even then I feel great!!)"}

It's not far to head here though if the other one has a fairly long wait. \\n\\nWe met up with our friends and shared a few items and got some individual tacos: \\n\\nTacos - they now offer pork belly which was rather tasty and tender so I definitely recommend getting it on something with it. Also got daegi gogi\/pork which is my other favorite taco. \\n\\nPork Belly Fries - Lots of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and pork belly. Messy, but good and a large share- able portion.\\n\\nFusion Wings - This comes with plain fries and the wings were nicely crispy with a sticky sweet and spicy glaze. Really enjoyable as I have a little bit of a affinity for sweet and spicy wings.\\n\\nFusion Flautas - This is one of my favorite things to get. The flautas are crispy and yet fluffy fried tortilla stuffed with a good portion of meat and cheese. I enjoy the mix of guacamole with sweet Korean sauce they do. I love that there is more than enough for the flautas and extra always to dip chips in! \\n\\nService was friendly enough. We had a second round of tacos and unfortunately it took long to get it. She did apologize and explain that a large party was before our order put in so not really their fault. \\n\\nThe food taste the same, which is a good thing and I saw one of the owners here running the front so I'm glad they seem to be doing right with consistency of a second location. Will be back, it's not far from my work."}
{"label":0,"text":"One star is being generous to say the least. My friend had people over to watch the fights and we decided to order pizza from this spot as it was a rock throw away. She called at 7:31 pm and ordered two extra large pizzas with 40 wings. My friend gave the cashier her name and phone number because the cashier needed to \\\"call back to confirm the order\\\"...??? After about 30 minutes of waiting my friend called to check up on the order and there was no record of it ever being placed. She ordered again and was told it would be 55 minutes. The manager said there was nothing that could be done... No rush or anything because they had no record. Worst customer service I've ever seen and I didn't even order the pizza. I am writing this review as a person who put in money and waited over 80 minutes for a pizza, with a group of others who were waiting as well. I think we need to call and order 15 pizzas and \\\"forget\\\" to confirm that we cancelled. This place has a manager that has no idea what customer service is. \\n\\nOrder here is you want to wait 80+ minutes for a pizza."}

The other au jus didn't even have a lid and was also spilt, there was about 1\/4 of it left. The sandwich was disgustingly soggy. They completely forgot our salad. When we called, we spoke to the manager who said they would give us $1.00 back for the salad, and would send us another sandwich, but refused to refund us.

{"label":4,"text":"Hands down the best buffet in all of Vegas and I've been to them all countless times over the years.  The only other buffet that comes close is at the Bellagio, but the Wynn's is better.  Rio is great too, but the Wynn serves a considerably higher level of cuisine.\\n\\nNormal dinner is $35.95 and I saw that on Fri\/Sat nights, dinner is $38.95.  I've had the dinner buffet here before and it was fantastic, but this time, I hit it for lunch and it was only $22.95.  The selection is not all that different from lunch to dinner and at that price, is just a few dollars more than a buffet at a place like Harrah's.  If you go for lunch, you can have the very best and it won't cost much at all, now that's true value.  Quality and selection-wise, there is just no comparison and with the exception of the Bellagio, nothing else comes close.\\n\\nI'm not even going to begin to describe all the incredible items that I saw and enjoyed.  One of my favorite regular items in their selection is the smoked salmon.  That's the first thing I go for every time.  Yikes, I must have eaten the price of admission in smoked salmon alone! :)  Even their dessert selection is downright astounding...all I can say is highly, highly recommended!\\n\\nIf you do only one buffet in Vegas, this is the one.  When I die, heaven better look like this!  Long live the king."}

This was a nightmare. I stood in a corner, trying to avoid the door that opened about every sixty seconds. I signed in, and waited 35 minutes to be called up. She confirmed my appointment, apologized, and said that I was next. I was then called back to the window a moment later and was handed a UA specimen cup...in front of the entire lobby! I was mortified. Once done with that mission, I didn't know what else to do, so I went back out into the lobby. \\n\\nBy this time there was almost no room to stand. People actually had to wait in the hallway. Another 15 minutes went by before I was called back for my blood draw. In that time, not one person was called back. 15 minutes!

{"label":4,"text":"Our most recent visit to Las Vegas led us to the Palazzo (because we made reservations of course). We have stayed at the Venetian on several occasions, so we wanted to check out the Palazzo.  \\n\\nCHECK IN:\\n\\nSince we were \\\"invited guests\\\" the check in was fast and easy. The person who checked us in ( I forgot her name) was uncommonly friendly and made us feel as though they could not wait for us to check in.  We appreciated the staff member's professionalism.\\n\\nROOMS:\\n\\nIn regards to the room, it was clean, new, and large.  The suites are about 70 square feet larger than the Venetian rooms, and the Palazzo rooms are obviously newer.  No jab at the Venetian because those rooms are very nice as well.  Back to the Palazzo rooms: The beds were extremely comfortable for us, and the room setup was excellent.  Everything was very clean and well-maintained.   \\n\\nBARS AND LOUNGES:\\n\\nEach bar or lounge we visited was well-maintained, and the staff was very professional.  Many of the bartenders engaged us, and others, in conversation and made drink suggestions.  \\n\\nRESTAURANTS:\\n\\nWe tried a few restaurants and received excellent service.  One of the resort perks was a coupon book that included drink coupons at the restaurants and other discounts in the Palazzo shops.  The staff was very friendly at each place where we redeemed coupons.  Specific reviews for locations within the Palazzo will be reviewed separately.\\n\\nPOOLS:\\n\\nYou can reach all of the Venetian and Palazzo pools within the same facility.  All of the pools and spas were clean and appeared well-maintained.  The grounds around the pools were beautiful, and the wait staff was attentive.\\n\\nHOUSEKEEPING:\\n\\nThe housekeeping staff was friendly as well.  I forgot a couple of items, and the housekeeping staff provided me with items quickly and for free.  \\n\\nLOCATION:\\n\\nThe location is outstanding.  It is located near Casino Royal, Harrahs, and the Wynn.  Many other casinos and hotels are nearby.\\n\\nBy far, the Palazzo exceeded our expectations, and we look forward to return soon!"}

That was until they changed directors. \\n\\nThey aren't consistent with sending home daily reports with the children. I'm the kind of parent that likes to know how my kids did in daycare. I like to know the good and the bad. When they sent home reports, hey would say \\\"had a great day!\\\" Well, what made their day so great? Also, they would send home a good report, but when I talk with the teacher, they would tell me how bad my child was. I asked why it wasn't on the reports I received and they said they write the reports mid day. How backwards is that? There are some teachers there who really seemed to care, but there seems to be too many cooks in the kitchen. The management team would often refer to \\\"the owners\\\" but when I asked who the owners were they said they don't distribute that information. Huh?! If someone is going to be around my children, I want to know who they are! They do have a clean facility. They also have a lot of different daily activities for the children to play with. But they need better trained staff. All of their teachers are not certified. \\n\\nAlso, I had an issue with kids bullying my son. They didn't try to resolve it. I requested a meeting with he kids parents because most people know that one major factor in resolving bullying is with the help of all parents involved. Well, they out right ignored me.

Like Kermit says though  \\\"it's not easy being green\\\".\\n\\nHowever, I do appreciate any business that is willing to be different and to provide a better way of living- give them plenty of kudos simply for that fact. It's not only food, some people don't know WF has a foundation that helps projects that life communities out of poverty, or a Local Producer Loan Program that gives low interest loans to small productions, or support wind and solar power farms to offset 100% of their electrical usage.\\n\\nFor someone who has food allergies, this place is their savior. For some, it is wholesome foods they can make a change with and I'm rooting for anyone who wants to live consciously.  For people like me though, I come for select things since I can't afford to go fully microbiotic\/organic, but I like to keep my home and foods as natural as possible. Going all natural in a world like today, specially in a city like Vegas isn't so easy. It's not like back home where LA has an abundance of big farmers markets and natural food stores to chose from. \\n\\nFirstly, toothpaste. This is the only place that carries Jason products and their Sea Fresh is the only toothpaste I use. I will not put any other toxic brand in my mouth. Never ever again. I love that they have a variety of natural products and I tend to buy things like shampoo here when I can't get to places like Lush.\\n\\nI buy mostly from the produce section. It's fresh, it's not too badly priced considering its natural and I find things here I have difficulty finding anywhere else- gold beets, chanterelle mushrooms, brussel sprouts fresh on the stalk, heirloom mini tomatoes,etc.\\n\\nTheir beer selection isn't wide, but it makes up for in selections. Often times when I am looking for a limited edition, I can find it here. In particular- Dechutes limited like Abyss and Jubel are often available.\\n\\nDeli is okay. I do love WF deli but this one compared to the Cali ones  and even the other Vegas branches has the most limited selection of the ones I've been in. It's still good quality, just sometimes I'm looking for a particular WF deli item I'm hankering for and this one does not have it. There's this quinoa salad I loved in La Jolla and I've seen it only at the LVB store. I also like their spicy soba noodles, rotisserie chicken and curry salad. \\n\\nEverything else is hit and miss. Some dry goods, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. I can find cheaper at other natural markets so it's about buying what is a reasonable deal here or getting things here that I cannot find elsewhere (black forest bacon for example). .  Check out the under $3 basket of cheese! I think this is great for a small dinner party since you can sample a load of cheeses that normally come in big $10+ hunks. \\n\\nAny serious and honest cook can't really denounce a place like this. For the their selection and a honorable mission I am a fan, even when it hurts my wallet."}

The clientele was mid 20's to 50's - with everyone quaffing while listening to some quality LCD soundsystem pumping out of the speakers - this for me was the highlight as I love a good place that gets the music loud enough that you can really feel it, but then still is just right to chat with your pal. \\n\\nThe Edinburgh bar is one of my fave brewdogs in UK - the only thing that let's it down is the quite rancid toilets which are like something from a small and pokey local train - with a smell to match! \\n\\nGo here for good beer and good vibes - it's as simple as that"}

{"label":3,"text":"This review is for a treatment I received in February of this year. Sorry for my tardiness.\\nI was at the Firesky for a conference. After hearing a number of conference attendees raving about the treatments they received at Jurlique, I was looking forward to getting in for a massage. I was scheduled at the end of the day, so I was a bit apprehensive about what the quality would be like - you know how the end of a workday can be. Was I silly to be worried!\\nJurlique is tucked into an building on the corner of the Firesky lot. It's got a small waiting area stocked with the typical spa goods and a few seats. An okay place for a short wait, and Enna, the front office clerk, was very welcoming.\\nWhen Kayleen came out to introduce herself as my therapist, I was a bit nervous. I'm used to getting worked on by sturdy Samoan gals, not tall willowy blondes. But my nerves were soothed the instant Kayleen the Massage Ninja plied her trade. I couldn't put my finger on what she was doing that was not only relaxing me but loosening me up until I asked Kayleen about her techniques. She combines massage with acupressure, and it works wonders! \\nBased on the experiences of our conference attendees, I'd say anyone at Jurlique can  deliver a great massage. Based on my experience, I can say that Jurlique should do whatever they can to keep Kayleen on staff!"}

Good size, nice decorations and never be super crowded and loud so you can enjoy being there and having conversation with your friends, partners or whoever you are with. Good thing about here is I think you can come here for any pursose. While there are many couples, I also saw some people having business dinner on weekdays. \\n\\nThe quality of food is absolutely fantastic! My favorite is PAD KRA-POW, YUM WOON SEN SEAFOOD and home made beef jerky. They are all amazing and I can eat this everyday. However, you have to be a little careful about choosing how spicy you want. I usually get between 5 to 7 out of 10 at Thai restaurants and when we first went there, I ordered \\\"medium\\\". Oh my got the food was very very spicy! I had probably 10 glasses of water until I finish my food but it was still good. When I asked the waiter if it was really medium, he said it was and he cannot eat medium too because it is too spicy. \\n\\nThey have nice selections of wine too. I hear the owner of the restaurant used to be a\\u3000sommelier at Lotus of Siam, another favorite restaurant of us in Downtown who also have so many kinds of wine. \\n\\nUnfortunatelly I have not tried their desserts yet because we always end up feeling like having shaved ice nearby (Kuma!!) on the way home.

Me no likey the soggy bok choi.  Love the chili mint noodles with shrimp cooked at #4.  The Thai BBQ Chicken is delish, which is much more tender than the chicken used in the soup & noodle dishes.  Also the best value on the menu as you get 1\/2 a chicken for $10, which is surprising when the Wor Wonton Soup is $11.\\n\\nCozy & inviting decor with warm colors and rich wood panels throughout.

I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.\\n\\nI went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!\\n\\nI rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.\\n\\nAll things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.  One thing that got me several times was the thought that I had dripped something onto the table.  When I looked, it was merely some spattered paint when they were decorating the tables.

They make a great summer drink, especially in this AZ heat.  I had the agua de sandia (watermelon), and my boyfriend tried the agua de fresa (strawberry) cremosa.  For the cremosa drinks they mix it with Carnation and sweet cream, and I have to say this is one of the thickest ones I've had before.  We ordered the queso fundido with jalapenos which I was really looking forward to.  However, this was a huge disappointment.  The waitress placed the plate down and I noticed that they served it with tortillas rather than tortilla chips.  I grabbed a piece of the tortilla, and went to scoop up some gooey queso fundido...except it wasn't gooey.  It was a gelatinous, almost solid bowl of cheese.  This didn't seem right to me.  We asked the waitress to warm it up some more, but it came back the same.  After asking her about it, she said they don't serve your traditional queso fundido.  They use mozzarella cheese which doesn't really melt to well...For dinner I had an order of the coctel de camaron (shrimp cocktail).  They are very generous with the shrimp.  Actually that's all that was really in there.  I would have preferred a little more avocado and  to have some cucumber in there was well.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, especially for their awesome aguas."}

Although the house was packed, we had a very competent, but indifferent waiter who may have spent too many years in the business to add anything special to the experience. With no other guidance other than \\\"whataya want?\\\", we fumbled our way without an app (no recommendation, no order), warm white wine (I had face my trashy side and put ice cubes in the wine) an uninspiring salad, and somehow, the \\\"parm and balls\\\" just didn't hit the same high notes.

Like you're Augustus Gloop drowning in Mr. Wonka's chocolate river.\\n\\nSo we tried the famous \\\"Chocolate pizza\\\" that this place is known for. And it really wasn't anything too special.

The music was literally the best I've ever had in a night of clubbing.  I seriously wish I could follow those DJ's around and club wherever they're going to play.  A con was the crowded-ness.  It is extremely frustrating when you love the song that's playing but can't dance to it because the coupleS next to you are bumpin and grindin and makin out violently which results in you getting pushed around and trampled.  Once we made it on to the side stage I was as happy as can be!"}
{"label":1,"text":"I lived at Paradise Palms for 2.5 years. The first year, I was on the north side in a split level condo and I down sized to the south side after making the desicion to go back to college. I was extremely disappointed when I moved into my apartment. Building 1501 #4 is not what the model apartment advertises. The wood laminate is different and ugly, there is carpet in the hallway and something is wrong with the flooring in the hallway as well(I think the carpet is kept to cover something up). I think the a\/c unit is at least 30 years old and you will pay for it if you live in those apartments. You will also be sweating while your thermostat says its set at 74 degrees. So in the summer time, my down sizing cost was a wash. Also to mention that anytime I would go into the office, Kevin would talk to me about partying and people crashing at his house because they were to drunk to drive all the way home from his house in Maricopa. (I have been sober for along time and found this extremely unprofessional). Last but not least upon my move out date, I ended up in the ER extremely ill. I tried to contact the office 8 times with one voicemail on my move out date to let them know that I was in the hospital. No one answered and no one called me back until the next day. It was Calvin the maintenence man. I told him what had happened and that I tried to call several times. His response was \\\"well you are probably going to have to pay for another day since you still have some stuff in the apartment.\\\" The maintenance man was telling me that I needed to pay more after being hospitalized!!!!! I told him \\\"no\\\", I won't be\\\" and that I will call back later when I was more lucid. So I tried to call 6 more times that day and no one answered. I showed up to the apartment in the evening time and got the 3 boxes and vacuum cleaner out of the apartment and went to drop off my keys. The new manager(who I believe was a poor decision in bringing on), was just sitting at her desk. The office was super quiet and her attitude was like I owed her something because her maintenance guy wasn't charging me for another day.........these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth and I am so grateful I do not live there anymore!!! Beware of the level of class you are getting at these apartments...you get what you pay for!!!"}

The Siena Italian Authentic Trattoria and Deli is like visiting Italy itself! Our waiter Todd was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu. His suggestions were top notch and he really helped make the experience the best possible. The spinach salad was so divine, and the deserts were exceptional. But, the pasta was the most amazing thing ever! We each got something different off the menu and we all tasted each others meals... they each were a different type of sauce and pasta and made your taste buds explode with flavor that was just divine and made you want more. I can't wait to go back. Well worth the 20 minute drive from Henderson!"}

They called at 3:30 to let me know they were running behind a little even though they still arrived in their time window. Jacob and Roy were very nice and professional. They did a thorough job and the carpets look awesome.  They even sanitized and deodorized where the dogs marked the floor.  I'll recommend them and use them again myself."}

{"label":3,"text":"I've been here a few times with our family.  This usually consists of myself, my husband, my 2-year-old, my 6-year-old, and my in-laws.  There isn't anything really that kid friendly on the menu, but they recommended a friend chicken cutlet that they cut up like chicken fingers.  The kids loved it.  Our sushi is always presented very well.  They cut carrots to look like birds.  I've never seen anything like it.  My kids were amazed.  We had to take the carrot birds home and put them in the refrigerator.  The sushi tasted really good.  We ordered a lot of sushi, but finished it between the four adults.  It was so good.  My father in law said the sushimi he ordered was really good.  I had hot sake, and my husband prefers the cold.  Both were really good.  It isn't the most kid friendly, but they do have high chairs available, and the wait staff is very patient.  Our service was good, because all of the waiters and waitresses just seem to work together.  No one is only responsible for their tables, we had drinks filled by whoever walked by.  Everyone seemed to be big on checking every table they walked by to make sure customers were pleased.  It has really good ambiance (in the evening) especially for a strip mall sushi place.  I was really pleasantly surprised.  If nothing else, it's worth coming here for presentation.  I'm really disappointed I didn't have my camera to photograph the way they plated our sushi."}

{"label":2,"text":"As a foodie, traveling through Phoenix, I was excited to be able to dine at Tarbells. Sadly, my experience did not live up to the billing. As a solo diner, it was obvious I was pegged as a \\\"turn and burn\\\". I was quickly served  a tasty olive oil and bread for dipping, however the bread tasted very much like frozen par  baked bread, that had been reheated. I would have expected something a little more refined in such a restaurant. The server, who when I asked about the menu, what she liked, did not tell me about the specials I heard her recite at other tables around me. I ordered the carpaccio which came out in less than 3 minutes. Obviously plated ahead and kept in the fridge with which I have no problem per se, but the chilled meat subtle taste was masked by the very cold what was beautifully marbled beef. Add to that, the overpowering amount of vinaigrette dressing on what looked like pretty arugula and the carpaccio was almost indiscernible. \\nOn the server's recommendation I ordered housemade ribbon noodles with homemade chicken fennel sausage, tomato, spinach in a rich buttery broth for my entree. What arrived was a very full bowl of broth that was very very rich with butter and for the first three spoonfuls was luxurious, but way too rich to be able to enjoy it in the quantity served. The fresh noodles that I had to search through the broth were stuck together in one mass under a small pile of canned tomatoes, the accompanying spinach also lost somewhere in the broth. The sausage looked like a breakfast pattie that had been browned on one side and then broken into pieces. Not what I was expecting. The fennel seed was so overpowering I could not eat it all.\\nBecause of the reputation and rave on line reviews I will tell myself, maybe I made lesser menu selections and will, when I am in Phoenix later in the year go back and try again. Fingers crossed."}

{"label":1,"text":"Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o\\n\\nI had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!\\n\\n I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50\/50 flour\/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.\\n\\nThe inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.  \\n  \\nMy grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.\\n\\nThe buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.  \\n\\nI'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :\/"}
{"label":2,"text":"Once you step into this place you are amazed at the money and creativity they put into this place. I totally could live in Lady Silvia and make is a batchelor pad loft, just by moving a few pieces of furniture out to make room for my bed. This place is super rad inside. The bartenders are great and very much good at sitting and talking to you and remembering your name and shaking your hand when you come in. The things that give it only 3 stars are the PRICE OF DRINKS, the gaming in the top of the bar and the never ending \\\"soft openings\\\". I wish they would just have the dadgum grand opening already!! The drinks are twice the price of the drinks at Artifice 3 blocks away and the table top gaming is irritating because it's what I DON'T want to see in an artsy fartsy bar in the Arts District. They are just in the way of putting your drinks down and all the times I've been in there I've not once seen someone playing on them. I usually bring friends in here to show them how awesome it is in there, have one drink ( because of the high prices) and then head on down the road to Artifice or Dino's where my booze money can go 2 to 4 times the distance. I would give this place a SOLID 5 stars if they would do away with the gaming and lower the drink prices. Just saying my piece Mike and Sam, you guys have a great bar.

I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \\\"no pink in the middle,\\\" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1\/2 inch thick, then the middle 1\/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.

The thing I hate the most was that they raised the Crab Dinner price to $15.99 (drink not included)!! That's 3 bucks more than when I use to come here not too long ago. That's a big difference. For just a few bucks more than that I can go to a seafood buffet with unlimited drinks. I don't think I'll be coming here again for the ayce crab dinner. It's no longer a great value."}

{"label":2,"text":"Readers of my review are going to have take it with a large pinch of salt ... just like the food here.  I readily admit to not having tried Cajun before so I'm hardly in a position to make authoritative comments or recommendations, comparing this place to other such restaurants.\\n\\nThere are two important things to know:\\n\\n1.  Jambalaya, which was once only served on Mondays, is now served every night;\\n2.  If you're not a fan of fried or smoked foods, this may not be the place for you.\\n\\nWe started out with the fais do do combo appetizer platter.  The onion rings, pickles and tomatoes were good, but all fried.  If you're not used to fried foods or don't like deep fried dishes, you may want to think twice, as they were deep fried with light batter and were VERY greasy (so much so, that when I picked up my unsweetened tea in the mason jar, it almost slipped out of my hand).  And although the pickles are full sours, combined with the fried batter, it was kind of salty.\\n\\nNow, to once again address the issue of salt, as I've done in other reviews:  we NEVER use salt at home and have a much lower tolerance for salt than most people; so bear that in mind, when I tell you, that we found the jambalaya and gumbo to be pretty salty.  Did I bother to ask them not to add salt, if that were possible?  Of course not!  So, I don't know whether that would've been possible; but at the very least, I can't complain about something I didn't bother asking about.\\n\\nPortions are large enough for the prices and the gumbo had a huge amount of meat in it; so don't think you're just getting a thick soup  (actually, more watery than thick, but no shortage of meat here!).\\n\\nDecorations are sparse, so don't come here for the atmosphere.  Service is fast and efficient.  Personally, I can do without the \\\"Cajun\\\" music in the background.  Sort of made me feel like I was having dinner on the set of Deliverance.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of Cajun food, I suspect you'll do very well here.  If you're going to experiment like we did, just remember:\\n\\n1.  Everything -- or practically everything -- is either fried or high in carbs;\\n\\n2.  Drinking out of the mason jars may be \\\"cute\\\", but not easy at times;\\n\\n3.  The salad that comes with dinner will leave you with the feeling, that, unless its fried, a vegetable is some fancy-shmancy foreign delicacy nowhere to be found in the Deep South;\\n\\n4. And if you're going to pick up an appetizer, DON'T -- I repeat:  DON'T -- touch any of your clothes, unless you intended to throw them away the next day  (if you insist, WD40 and baking soda will go a long way in removing those annoying grease stains).\\n\\nOverall, tasty, if not also salty; reasonably priced; different.; but not enough to make me go for a return visit.  Sorry, just not my taste."}

It wasn't spicy and overall it was  just a terrible dish.\\n\\nAside from that, the sandwiches also looked mundane. One item I would suggest is the Mushroom Lovers Pizza. That is if you love mushroom and flatbread pizza. \\n\\nThis is definitely the kind of place where the environment and style undermines the food. The service was good. In fact, it was toooo good.

My boyfriend got a hot dog that the staff shoved into the bag so the bun got all ripped up and they shorted him on his 6$ small drink. It had an inch and a half of space left when he recieved it. I wouldn't normally care that it wasn't all the way full but when you pay 6$ for a drink you expect it to be filled. Then the girl checking us out had no people skills and kept looking at us like she wanted us to leave.  But we finally get into the movie and it's a good movie but the usher kept patrolling constantly through the movie and he was distracting. He walked through the theater at least 4 times clicking his counter each time. The movie was great but I don't think I'll be back at GVR again I'm gunna stick with south point and save 10$ and not have to deal with an usher who doesn't know how to do his job well enough to not distract people from the movie they payed good money for.

I hate biting into large chucks of veggies.  Great seasoning was used as well, spicy, but not too hot.\\n\\nI will definitely roll back over to Big Al's from The Strip the next time I'm in Vegas.  For the quality of the meal and the good prices, $12 for the Po Boy (2 large crabs) and another $12 for two good size crab cakes with real crab lump meat. I'll be a repeat customer."}

When I got inside and realized how packed the place was, I decided to order the food to go. \\n\\nSo, based purely on what I could eat while driving, I had to say no to the biscuits and gravy I so love or their fluffy pancakes. I narrowed it down to handheld food; sandwiches. Almost went with their catfish or grilled chicken, but ended up with the meatloaf sandwich (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite). \\n\\nThe sourdough bread (which had some sort of glaze) was really good, but it wasn't toasted so the meatloaf started to make the bread soggy. And their meatloaf wasn't thick and generous like I've had at BJ's or other restaurants. And because it wasn't made too firm, it kept falling out of the sandwich and onto my shirt (lucky, no car accidents). \\n\\nThe store had neat stuff (bought a cow mug that had utters) to browse while waiting for my meal and the servers (thanks Jenifer) were great.

For example, if someone wants a different sauce with their pasta or their entree prepared a certain way, why would the owner refuse to do so ?  I've seen this happen twice at this restaurant and both time guests have been put in unpleasant positions while ruining their dining experience.

The eggs were super weird but I liked the sauce. I wanted to like it more, afterall, I have heard so much about CPK (confession: I've maybe been here once in my entire life).

The spa is small and is nothing more than a converted hotel room so the area is not super fancy.

Once in the room my masseuse never asked where I wanted to focus on or what to avoid. The massage itself was ok but she hit the bad spot on my back twice without even acknowledging it. Most of the time they will question my tenderness there and offer some suggestions but not this time. But the massage could have been worse because while I was having my mediocre massage my husband was next to me having the worst massage of his life. By the time his masseuse had coughed the third time over him I expected him to insist the massage ended. Needless to say this will be our last Hands on massage."}
{"label":0,"text":"TOP FLOOR ROOMS NOT SAFE DURING HEAVY RAIN!  Rude front desk that doesn't care about guest safety. \\n\\nWe were staying on the 28th floor.  It was raining and there where some leaks in the hall.  All of the sudden the alarm goes off- we wait for a while- it is still going off.  We head into the hall to see if anyone can tell is what is going on.  We see a panicked woman visiting the US for Austrailia.  She is scared and so we headed down the fire escape.  About the 14th floor we couldn't hear the sirens so we exited the stairwell and we could still hear the alarm.  We didn't know if the elevators were safe.  The fire exit path was not marked as you headed out to the roof over the casino so we had to try several doors at each turn.  We finally get into the hotel and no one knows what we are talking about.  We are told to go to the front desk. \\n\\nAt the front desk we hailed a manager.  Our Australian women was still shaking so I went and got her a chair from the Casino.  It was right at shift change so the first manager told us it was a false alarm and we would be moved.   She passed us off to Mildred.  She was nice.  We were downgraded rooms in the move so we asked for a manager.  \\n\\nRyan Ramsey came up.  He offered to comp our night for tonight.  When we asked about the fire escape not being marked he just said \\\"what do you want me to do?\\\"  When we asked if it was the same kind of room and he said since we didn't pay for the upgrade we weren't entitled to any else.  We said we were very scared and upset he smirked and told us \\\"I don't know what you want me to do...\\\"  \\n\\nWe asked why no one- even the front desk manager knew about the alarm as they could be checking people into unsafe rooms.  He said they had already stopped checking people into those rooms because of the leaks.   We asked why we had t been called with an offer to move- he said \\\"we just don't do that\\\"\\n\\nWe asked to speak to his manager.  He said there was no one we could talk to.  That there was no one there higher up than him.  If we wanted to complain we had to email the vp of operations.  We questioned that there was no management level between him and her and he said no.  \\n\\nAt this point now were are furious- he says something like \\\"I comped you for tonight I don't know what you want me to do\\\". He was INCREDIBLY condescending.  He also told us how frustrated he was because he just got here and he got this problem thrown at us.  We tried to ask him if he was frustrated how did he think we felt.  He didn't care.  \\n\\nWe went upstairs and the bellman was not there because we hadn't gotten back from the front desk.  Honestly at this point we were a little scared and just wanted out of the room.  We called another bellman and shoved everything into bags as fast as we could.  We warned a few guests that the alarm had gone off and there where leaks in our rooms.\\n\\nI got a call from Raina who said Ryan had said that there was a problem.

Since we needed to get back to the strip proper for a show, we booked dinner for 7 PM. The dining room was fairly empty for a Saturday night post New Year's when we showed up, but by the time we finished eating it had filled up nicely. As with the rest of the Palms, N9NE presents a hipster image. The dining room features lots of white, chrome, and purple light. The speakers blared AC\/DC and The Killers at volumes loud enough to make a conversation between two people difficult.\\n\\nDrinks and bread arrived quickly. We skipped appetizers as they are almost all seafood\/shellfish based (allergies), and instead split a generous Caesar salad. I wished there were some larger slivers of parm and a less creamy dressing, but it was still good. For my entree I had a filet. I ordered it blue, but what arrived was more what I'd consider rare. There was some kicky seasoning on the meat, and it was served in jus with a sprig of rosemary that scented it nicely. For a side we split the steak fries, which were nicely crispy and greaseless. The servers and dining room support staff worked swiftly and unobtrusively. We skipped desserts (needed to save room for more drinks), but they looked fun... a table near us was toasting their own S'mores on a tabletop grill (but not well, unfortunately, and we were prompted to leave not just by our other commitment but also by the icky smell of scorched marshmallow and chocolate). \\n\\nSo, this was good, but I don't feel the need to go there again. The cut and cooking of the meat did not compare to my Vegas favorite Craftsteak, and truthfully the filet I had at the Ann Arbor Chop House the week before was of better quality and texture."}

They were already out of the wings on special. After this bit of bad news, we asked for a minute to pick something else, but put in an appetizer order. Quite a while later the server came back and dropped off the drinks, but before we could even stop her to finally place our order she was gone...and didn't return before our drinks were finished (about 20 minutes). We decided to give up on eating since God knows how long it might have taken to actually get the food if we ever finally got to place an order.     \\nOther notes: \\n-The booth was covered in grease and crumbs so apparently somebody actually was served food at this table at one point\\n-Getting to the restroom was kind of a cluster maneuvering through the servers entering orders\\n-The whole place seemed almost chaotic and unorganized with food and drinks being brought to wrong tables\\n\\nMaybe another week of preparation before the opening would've been a good idea. i'm hoping the kinks will get worked out soon because we really want to like this place.

Sub Station II seems to be just a simple \\\"Ham & Cheese\\\" type of place. They have a selection of deli meats, a range of your typical toppings, and a few choices or bread or wrap. I don't think you're going to find a meatball or philly cheesesteak kind of sandwich here.\\n\\nThe first couple of days I gave the salads a go. The were kind of bland as you get a bed of shredded lettuce with pre-selected toppings and the sliced up deli meat. On the other days I gave a few sandwiches a try. They were alright.

The deal also included $20 food and beverage credit, which can be used at mostly bars, and the one restaurant I saw on there, which was the steakhouse (which is on the pricier side. Look up my review of the steak house at camelot for more info on the coupon there). Also included was a free play at the Dungeon, aka the midway arcade. The coupon book didn't include any match plays, unfortunately.\\n\\nThe room itself was nice. Spacious enough. The tv is large. There is an ethernet cable for you to plug into your computer for wired internet service. The internet was a bit slow. \\n\\nThe beds were fine.

{"label":4,"text":"Fili-B's is the closest thing you can get to real Mexican food in the Phoenix valley. It is dirty and slightly unnerving when you order the first time but in my opinion, it is well worth it. Some people violently disagree and aren't willing to chance getting the runs to eat here, but for me that is a chance I will willingly take. \\n\\nMy order is essentially the same every time: a massive carne asada burrito with a large horchata. So, the moral of the story is that Filibertos isn't for everyone, but for those who aren't afraid of possibly eating cat, it is a winner. It is also very inexpensive so it is popular with the college crowd. Try it."}
{"label":0,"text":"What a terrible experience.  I love Houston's and there are very few restaurant chains that I can say that about.  I look forward to going to a Houston's any time I can.  We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \\\"sorry we are closing and so longer serving\\\".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!"}

Total lack of professionalism.They don't smile nor do they seem to care about doing their jobs very well.\\nI don't think it's appropriate to look like that when serving the public. Women go there to dine too, not just men so if that is to be the uniform then please make it equal and put some of the waiters in something just as revealing so us women can have eye candy too. \\n\\nI had one waitress many times who was always so rude. She spoke only french and while I am bilingual, when I'm spending my money and I'm the customer I want to be served in my language. After I answer her in english she would respond to me in french. That's rude. The least she could have done was go get someone who could speak english to wait on us.\\n\\nThe male waiters are far superior than the women.

{"label":1,"text":"I visited Siena on Tuesday with a bridal shower party of 16. The private room we were given was beautiful, but that was the end to the perks of the restaurant. The bread service had pita chips and bread with an olive tapenade. It comes in ramekins that hold 1 tablespoon of tapenade, and given to share among 4 people. So, we were pretty much all able to have 1 slice of bread with tapenade on it. Wonderful!\\n\\nWe split an aragula salad which was actually very tasty. It had figs and some tasty cheese, but a tad too much dressing. That was the best part of my meal. My mother-in-law next to me ordered the penne (I think) and the pasta looked homemade. I suppose that's the one up-side of this place. Several of the pasta dishes looked like it was homemade pasta, but me, wanting to be healthy, opted for something low-carb. When it came to ordering, I opted for the salmon with a side of asparagus (4 stalks). My friend next to me ordered the same thing, and we were both incredibly disappointed. The salmon looks like it was butterflied in half so that we each got about 3 oz. of salmon that was incredibly thin. Mine was over-cooked to say the least, but hers was burned. The whole outside was black and charred... Unfortunately, the salmon which came highly praised by the waiter (whom I only saw one time when he took my order), was so small that I ended up starving and eating a bunch of bread just to fill up. So much for low carb. \\n\\nSince our party was so large, there was an automatic 20% gratuity attached onto it, which would be fine, if I ever got a refill on my water glass. I was so thirsty, I almost drank my friend's water. Sorry, but I will never be back. I think most of the people at my table shared this sentiment. My total for half a of a salad, very poorly cooked, thin salmon, and 4 stalks of asparagus with 20% gratuity was $36. I think I could have purchased a weeks worth of wild salmon and cooked it better myself."}

Had we sat to the right of us at the bar or to the left of us at a different table, we would have saved about 50% on our bill.  Even the manager would not override it.  They said that we sat at a private table, this table was sandwiched between the front entrance gate and the front door of the restaurant, nothing private about it.

{"label":2,"text":"Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- d\\u00e9cor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.\\n\\nMenu has several breakfast choices, of which I am not a fan. The soups and salads are all solid, but the sandwiches are hit or miss- please note that the Philly comes with Velveeta, which will put off many people (myself included). The Hero is delectable and a generous portion, too. The same can be said for the sea salt fries it is served with- the kitchen is a bit heavy-handed with the salt flakes, and despite the presence of Cholula at the condiment bar, I had to ask staff for ketchup. Who had to ask the chef to bring out a ramekin from the kitchen. For KETCHUP. At a place that serves FRIES. Found this incredibly odd and awkward.\\n\\nThe 5 cheese macaroni is one of the best I've had with a good, thick roux and curly cavatappi noodles. However, for a $7 side it's practically an entree it's so rich. Recommend cutting the portion and price to make it a side, and maybe offering an additional $9 portion as an entr\\u00e9e, perhaps with a protein."}

{"label":0,"text":"Ate twice at Mozen Bistro for breakfast while staying at the Mandarin. Unfortunately, I am forced to give this place a 1 star rating.\\n\\nAfter waiting what seemed like an eternity to be served (greater than 45 minutes), I found a LONG black hair entwined in my Huevos Rancheros. It was beyond disgusting! I have no idea how they didn't see it in there. The eggs were literally stuck to and hanging off the hair when I lifted my fork. \\n\\nI was absolutely starving and was nearly about to cry at the sight of the hair. When I reported it to our waiter, he apologized and took the plate. While they were preparing a new order, I had to pick off of everyone else's plate because I was so hungry. I grudgingly ate the newly prepared huevos, and only because I was still hungry... otherwise I would have bailed on the whole situation.\\n\\nThis definitely isn't the first hair that I've found in food, but it's pretty disturbing when you find one at a place that charges $12 for a bowl of Cheerios. Mozen is expensive and exclusive. It should be held to a higher standard than iHop when it comes to quality control. \\n\\nWhy the 1 star? \\n\\n* Hair in food. Probably enough said.\\n* For an insanely overpriced restaurant in an exclusive hotel, I felt that the hair warranted an apology from the restaurant manager or someone in charge. When you make a mistake of this magnitude, it deserves a sincere apology.\\n* They only comped my huevos rancheros on the bill. I felt that was kind of chintzy.\\n\\nWhat could have earned a 3 star?\\n\\n* An apology from management\\n* A more generous compensation than just simply replacing the hair-laden dish with a new one and not charging for it. I probably think the whole bill should have been comped since it was only breakfast and not like a $400 dinner bill. And I was a guest at the hotel."}
{"label":3,"text":"I love staying at this hotel because of the modern design and layout. I think it is more suited for younger crowds with all the technology and gadgets located in the rooms. Everything from the t.v. to the curtains opens when you first enter the room. So many crazy buttons to press, but that's what makes things fun. The beds and pillows are really comfortable and they have a flat screen t.v. with all these ports! I suggest bringing an HDMI cable if you want to play any movies or shows from your laptop onto the big flat screen. This place is also good since it is kind of located in the middle of the strip so it is easy to get to the nearby hotels. I would stay here again on my next visit."}

I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\\n\\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\\n\\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.

{"label":1,"text":"Soooooo, there was an online article about Sweet Tea's that caught my attention. I decided to give it a try. First impression? The small waiting area\/entrance had items of trash on the floor and newspapers in disarray on a stand. Once I entered the restaurant there were 4-5 employees sitting at a table (meeting?) obviously too busy to clean the entrance area. As I was seated by the hostess I noticed 3 more employees come into the restaurant, none of them bothered to clean the entrance way or pickup the trash. The floor of the restaurant was sticky in some areas and very slippery in other areas. Did I mention an employee's cell phone was near the cash register and kept ringing? (not to mention the ring tone was annoying). The food was mediocore. Terrible cornbread! The restaurant is 'drafty' so bring a sweater\/jacket. The shrimp & grits dish is commendable yet I dont think they are 'Charleston' grits. \\nLong short, I would not suggest you rush to visit Sweet Tea's....it's not worth it."}

{"label":3,"text":"Yet another great Charlotte restaurant I'm not sure why I've yet to review. As a sushi aficionado the Cowfish is an obvious choice. They've taken it upon themselves to lead the fusion charge in a seriously unexpected direction by mixing the delicious creatures of the land and sea in one meal for us to delight in. Well, at the time of this review I suppose it's safe to say most fusion sushi joints have pretty much joined the \\\"let's add beef to our sushi\\\" bandwagon. But as far as I'm concerned, not only was The Cowfish first, but it still stands in my mind as the best.\\n\\nFirst off, there's getting in here. You've essentially gotta reserve a table. Don't walk up thinking \\\"I've heard of this pace and have to check it out, I'll go in!\\\" You will be hard pressed to find a table or even a spot at the bar on most nights. They book up quick and keep a waiting line out the door in most cases. It's all for good reason. There is an experience point to the place as well you know. Interior layout and decor is great. Comical actually, especially if you read a little Japanese and are familiar with the culture. The posters specifically are entertaining. Also, don't forget to take a trip to the restroom while you're here. You can relieve yourself to the sounds of random phrases spoken in English then in Chinese. It's...seriously random. They aren't even useful phrases. You'd pee yourself laughing if you weren't already peeing.\\n\\nService has been stellar in my experience so far. I've accompanied plenty of out-of-towners here and anytime somebody in the party hasn't been here before the waitstaff gives you a rundown of the menu, lots of recommendations and generally what to expect when you read the word \\\"burgushi\\\". This is great considering the menu is margin-to-margin on most pages and never-ending with options. I'm a sushi guy so naturally I gravitate towards the burgushi options. Surf 'n Turf is my personal go to favorite. It's like comfort food at the end of a long week. Angus beef tops a roll filled with salmon, tuna and cream cheese flash fried to the perfect texture. Or try the Lamb-urgushi. The name alone is funny enough to make you do it.\\n\\nThey've got a full bar that basically wraps around 3\/4 of the restaurant. No small part of that is a sushi bar and half of the bar-top is laden with built in touchable gaming screens with lots to choose from. Outdoor seating abound for the warmer days and enclosed outdoor seating for the cold and wet days. If you're passing through, check it out, but if you live here you owe it to yourself as a Charlottean to come here at least once."}

{"label":0,"text":"I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered. \\n\\nA friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W. \\n\\nThe downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever. \\n\\nAlas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much. \\n\\nI tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us. \\n\\nI should've stepped in and said \\\"look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack.\\\" \\n\\nIn the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways. \\n\\nIt's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event. \\n\\nI never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way. \\n\\nPretentiousness is next to ugliness. \\n\\nIf I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do. \\n\\nSo I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain. \\n\\nBlow me, W... you $#&@"}

She was working alone and although there were only a few tables, she stayed busy! I looked at the menu for a few before I decided on the angry dog and the euro fries. I paid, just about $14, and sat down and waited. \\n\\nThe food took about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all considering everything is cooked to order. My food came out steaming, a good sign! The angry dog came piled high with spicy bulgogi, jalape\\u00f1os, slaw and spicy mayo. I had to eat it with a fork and knife it was that big. The flavors were wonderful. It wasnt too spicy at all, even with all the chopped jalape\\u00f1os. That was a damn good hot dog. The fries however, were just ok for me. They came with pork belly, cheese and garlic mayo on the top. I liked the pork belly and the mayo, but probably could have done without the cheese. The actual fries themselves were seasoned and wayyyyy too salty, so that ruined the dish for me.

But I had expected more of you.\\n\\nThe food was, at best, so-so. Incredibly salty (I am speaking especially of the prosciutto balls and the lentils), not exactly attractively presented, and accompanied by the worse bread I have ever had the misfortune of being insulted with. I felt like Oliver twist, trying to break off a cold hunk of charred dough to eat, plain, until I could flag  down our waiter for some olive oil.\\n\\nOh, and in the past, on the rare occasion when the wine I select is unavailable, I've always been offered the closest similar bottle at the same price (if it was more expensive). You should think about this if your wine list isn't going to be current.\\n\\nI don't have unreasonable expectations for this sort of casual dining, and I know you are an awesome chef, Mario, but this place is an embarrassment to your good name."}

My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful. \\n\\nThe menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!\\n\\nAnd the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen. \\n\\nThe goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.\\n\\nThough I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths."}

After eating here, I wasn't one bit sad that I was leaving Phoenix.\\n\\nIf interested, you can read my review of El Encanto Dos as well. Surprisingly, the reviews are almost opposite (you'd think they'd be similar if owned by the same people).\\n\\nFirst look, I wasn't amazed. Of course, the pond and the ducks are great, but it produces demanding birds that the net over the pond can't completely prevent. We went early in the evening on a weekday, maybe right around 5pm and it was pretty empty. Our server was very attentive at first, but strayed a bit towards the end. I'm not going to say anything else about the service; I've only been there once and I'm hoping that bad service isn't a theme with the Encanto restaurants.\\n\\nThe margarita...I don't remember much about it, so I\\\"m going to say it wasn't memorable. The food was memorable, only in that it was such a bore. I got a quesadilla and could have gotten something more interesting\/tastier at Denny's. In fact, I was really astounded at the boringness of the food. Everyone I was with at the table said that they thought the meal was lacking in a way.\\n\\nThis visit took place in mid-May 2010, and I'm not sure if they had just gotten a new cook, or had some other issue. That is the only time I've been there, so I can't testify to much...but when I go back to visit Phoenix, I won't be going to El Encanto."}

The ambience is very nice and relaxing. I would advise against wearing heels though. I was in wedges and found it very difficult to walk on their uneven flooring. Our server was amazing. He made suggestions of his favorite menu items and was very attentive. If you are starving, you will need to order more than one menu item. This restaurant serves very...how do you put it...healthy-sized portions of food. I'm tiny and I needed 2 things. Each dish runs about $15 unless you order just bacon, toast or cornbread. Then it's about $6. The food is rather tasty, but it wasn't $30-tasty.

The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it.

The sandwich was perfectly toasted and crunchy on the outside and had a reasonable amount of filling on the inside that was melty, ooey and gooey the way a grilled cheese should be.  My only request would be more of the vinegary pork and bourbon onions to add more acid and cut through some of the richness of the mac n cheese.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a good sandwich served by friendly folks and I would not hesitate to stop by the next time our clocks align!"}

I was shocked at the prices for being a fast food place with a drive-thru. The tacos are $3 each and that is before toppings. If you want cheese, avocado and sour cream it will cost you $5 per taco. The tacos tasted somewhat OK but some of my asada meat was cooked crispy and it seemed the tacos were filled with more salsa and junk then meat. It was a hot damn mess to eat. I just don't like getting ripped off when the taco doesn't even taste authentic and the tacos are overpriced. If you see the picture of my 2 tacos you will think it looks good but are you willing to pay $10 plus tax for them? After buying a drink my total was almost $14. Like I said it didn't taste bad but it wasn't anything close to Tacos El Gordo which is in the same parking lot and right next door! Just go to El Gordo trust me!"}

We originally couldn't agree on a fry selection, but when I asked if I could just get a side of fries, the waitress told me that they only do fries for the buckets.....so, sweet potato fries it is (for about $2 more).\\n\\nI'm a little confused on their HH pricing though.\\nOur waitress told us that it was \\\"all half priced\\\", the sign on the outside of the building says half off on pizza and all drinks.\\n\\nOur pizza arrives first, and it was very good. I was pretty surprised. The big hunks of cilantro really added a burst of freshness, that the pizza needed. The BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me. A few drops of hot sauce would have really added an extra POW.\\n\\nThe bucket of chicken tenders arrives next. The fries were delicious, almost melt in your mouth fantastic. They were so airy. The chicken tenders were a tad lack luster. The breading was tough, even after being coated in sauce. \\n\\nWhen I order tenders\/wings, I'm expecting a hot sauce with some flavor... I want to taste some vinegar, some spices....not just heat. So, would I order these again..? Not really.\\n\\nMy guy asked for some extra celery, and our gal comes back with an entire plateful. While this was very thoughtful, I would have appreciated a hint drop of a charge of $3 for celery. \\n\\nSo, our bill comes.\\nShot of Jack $6.\\nStella beer $7.50\\nBBQ pizza $9\\nTender Bucket $$11.99\\nSide of celery $2.50\\nCarrots $.75\\n\\nSo, where's the HH pricing on our drinks...? Is it just me?\\nBecause a $6 shot doesn't sound half off...unless they have \\\"strip\\\" pricing, and their shots are normally $12.... Same goes for the beer. Unless their normal pricing is $15 for a beer..... I don't see this being a decent HH.\\n\\nAlso, charging me for carrots....really? You're talking about the 2 or 3 carrots that were at the bottom of our chicken tender bucket..?\\n\\n$40 before tip, not bad for a night out, but when we came for HH pricing, that's kind of high."}

It is one of the few unique zoos where the visitor follows a designated path through the lushes forests and is immersed in the world of the animals, discovering a little frog under the leaf, a bird in the trees, a turtle crawling on the ground, it brings a sense of wonder and discovery for both adults and children, from tropical to arctic to the ocean.

{"label":2,"text":"SHOPS & RESTAURANTS THAT FALL FAR BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE STRATOSPHERE\\n\\n  The Stratosphere Tower Shops are what the Forum Shops are to Caesar's Palace and Miracle Mile is to Planet Hollywood. It is the shopping mall of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino. This the one thing that it shares in common with the casino malls. Whereas the majority of casino malls celebrate their host property while showcasing an exciting selection of shops and restaurants,  the StratosphereTower Shops fall far below the level of the stratosphere in selection and shopping environment. It is more of the level of a retail and restaurant pergatory.\\n\\n  I am no stranger to the Stratosphere Tower Shops. I have walked its corridor before and after hanging out all the way up in the Level 107 Lounge or the observation deck. When I walk the Stratosphere Tower Shops, I am 106 levels below the Level 107 Lounge and one level above the casino. When I enter the mall to head to the 107 Lounge elevator, it is via the escalator by the center casino bar.The first thing I see when the escalator reaches the mall is a faux tower foundation. It is hard to tell if it is supposed to be a faux foundation of the Stratosphere Tower or the Eifel Tower. However, it is easy to tell that I am looking at the Golden Arches. Generally speaking the food selection here stinks. For me Chicago Hot Dogs, Tropical Smoothie, a pizza concession, and McDonald's doesn't cut it. This is the start of a windy hall toward the attractions elevators and ultimately to the theater where the second escalator reaches the north section of the casino.\\n\\n  The Stratosphere Tower is the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. When I walk through the mall I ask myself, \\\"When I walk through the gateway to the Stratosphere Tower, why do I feel like I am in a second tier outlet mall?\\\" There is a want of a celebration of the Stratosphere and spirit to the hallway. I pass by theme areas that seem random and make no sense. First there is the Metropolitain area that bares an infinitesimal resemblance to France with the exception of a faux tower foundation. This barely resembles the Eifel Tower and could be mistaken for the observation deck base. As I continue ubexcitingly walking through the mall, I enter a Chinatown theme area. The shops and restaurants have as much in common with Chinatown as New York New York has in common with the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. I don't get it. As I walk on  unexcidedly I see gift stores, a popcorn store, art gallery, tattoo shop, jewelry shop, and arcade. Please note that under this business listing I posted a tip displaying the mall directory. The most interesting display to catch my eyes are the two storefronts displaying Hello Kitty and an arcade with a bull statue. When I look around,  I think to myself that the Stratosphere Tower Shops could use some life in its halls. To bring it from its dead spirit, restaurants and bars that overflow with tables ovetlooking the mall could bring it to life. Maybe a couple of kiosks minus aggressive venders in the center, or performers. As my footsteps increase, I see a ramp ahead with overhead signing to the attractions elevators that are on the right. A few feet further, the mall peters out at the theater where the escalator descends to the casino level. \\n\\n   The Stratosphere Tower Shops has so much potential to be a mall that could knock my socks off. What other mall could boast of having the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River as an anchor?  To make this happen,  my mindset is that  management will need to facilitate a major refurbishment of the mall that will bring in exciting stores and restaurants with a theme that celebrates the Stratosphere. Until that happens,  I see the Stratosphere Tower Shops as a walk through an unexciting  gateway  to the exciting tallest structure west of the Mississippi River."}

It's all so charming and beautiful. The ceiling is painted like a beautiful sky, and it is lovely. The fake apartments have windows over the shops that have red geraniums in the window boxes, just like in Paris. \\n\\nThe rooms are a bit plain, though, and not indicative of the Parisian theme of the hotel and casino. I don't know if I'd pay such expensive prices and want such plain-o rooms. \\n\\nThe casino also now has a weird smell that smells of stale cigarettes and restrooms that permeates the casino. Ugh. I hope they can get rid of that soon. I know they  just had a bunch of traveling shows and tournaments go through here, but they need to rectify the smelly situation immediately.\\n\\nThey have a great buffet and many great restaurants at this hotel (I like Le Cafe, Sugar Factory, and Le Provencal (I ate there 5 years ago, though, so I can't say what it's like now). I used to love Le Notre bakery, but now it's Cafe Madeleine?

Either way, it's gorgeous.\\n\\nThere's a big circular pool (not very exciting for the kiddies) that is right under the Eiffel Tower, and it's adorable.

{"label":3,"text":"everyone needs to try the broccoli bites, first off. probably the best ever. i also had the greek pizza which was also delicious. prices are reasonable as well. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars, is that the service wasn't the best ever. there were no servers, just the bartender, and he was rather slow and we had to ask for water refills. (the bar section wasn't busy either) but he was friendly, so i can't complain too much. i'd definitely go back. oh, another bonus: they serve pizza super late!"}
{"label":2,"text":"As a served buffet sushi restaurant, Kanda would be a rare bird on the west coast, but is surprisingly a common style over here. For your $15-25 (depending on when you go) the result is very much dependent on the ebb and flow of the restaurant.\\n\\nWhy? Because you literally order from a list. Each table has a sheet that you fill out with a pencil - maybe you want 1 roll here, 1 gyoza there - in an all-you-can-eat format. Some food is going to be cooked specifically for you, while others might come as part of a larger batch. (There's a price penalty for uneaten food.)\\n\\nIn theory, this is great. You could order one from everything on the menu if you have the stomach for it! In practice, this means there is batch cooking, which means you might get something piping fresh one minute and something from the waiting line the next. (The busy nature of the place seems to ensure your food is mostly fresh, though.) For better or worse, the chaos spills over to the waiting too; while food delivery is almost always prompt, drinks\/orders\/bills may take some chasing to make happen.\\n\\nI think the Kanda experience is best described as a search for \\\"surprise\\\". The menu is build to have you hunting outside your comfort zone, trying out various items you may have not tried before. As a group experience, that's great. As a seasoned sushi-connoisseur experience, you may want to look elsewhere."}

{"label":3,"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by my stay. I booked my hotel\/flight for 3 nights through Southwest Vacations all for ~$500. But shortly after, reading some reviews got me a bit worried. Here are some things I would like to clarify after reading some reviews.\\n\\n1) Resort Fee - YES. Unfortunately this a trend in Las Vegas. Aria is certainly not the only hotel to have this and unfortunately it is one of the higher resort fees. It gives you access to the Gym, Free internet throughout the ENTIRE casino, some random other things - it does NOT give you access to the spa (my one major let down). The spa facility charges $30 just for entrance.\\n\\n2) Housekeeping - COMES EVERYDAY. I'm not sure who's review it was that I read but they complained about not getting their room serviced... uhm.. definitely not true. Perhaps they forgot they had their \\\"privacy\\\" light on. The control panel by the front door has a button for \\\"Lights\\\" \\\"Privacy\\\" and \\\"Service.\\\" They did such a great job cleaning my crap everyday. No complaints from me.\\n\\nNow onto some of my observations\/experiences.\\n\\n- Rooms: SO SPACIOUS! Got a large king bed that was ubbber comfy. I slept so well every night. I loved that there was a button next to the bed labeled \\\"Good Night\\\" and it would 1) turn off all the lights in the room 2) electronically pull the sheer and solid curtain. In the morning, I heard the solid curtain open up. It was a great way to wake up - I didn't have the sun blaring into my eyes but I could still see the daylight. LOVED it.\\n\\n- Bathroom: I really loved the bathroom. Nice big tub (big enough for 2) with a nice shower. Great temperature control and pressure. \\n\\n- Bathrobes: LIKE A DREAM. Okay I admit.. I pretty much changed out of my regular clothes as soon as I got in to the room just so that I could put on the robe. Yes.. that comfortable.\\n\\n- In room service: Okay.. food was so-so... err.. okay so-so may be actually generous. I ordered probably the most bland quesadilla in my life. \\n\\n- Rest of the hotel: I really liked having different elevators for different floors. I was on the 25th floor. There were 4 elevators dedicated for just the 25-30th floors. I never waited long. The elevators were amazingly fast and quiet. Pools looked awesome - didn't actually go into them but there were so many different ones.\\n\\n**TIP**: expect to pay MORE $$ for any taxi ride going TO aria\/cosmopolitan - the road that leads to their front goes through some weird back route and unfortunately that tacks on maybe $4 -5 bucks. If you are coming FROM the airport, take the shuttle that is $6\/person one way. The taxi ride will be ~$20. On the other hand, if you are GOING to the airport, its a quick ride ~$12.00."}

Saw this place on yelp and I am so glad that I stopped inside!\\n\\nWhen I got there, some people were waiting and they chatted me up to say that they had been here at least a dozen times and are in total love with the place. They warned me that I may become addicted...and I think I am. \\n\\nI was placed in a semi-private room. The foot soak was quite relaxing and the masseuse asked me if I wanted to do just the foot massage or the back\/foot combo. My back had been bothering me so I opted for the combo. \\n\\nThe male masseuse (I wish I had gotten his name) was amazing. Super polite and checked in with me to make sure he was applying the correct pressure.

Yes, it is a popular place and many others know it, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar (if there is space) before your table is ready.\\n\\nWhere to start once you are seated?  A drink, for sure...and they are known for their many choices of beers. Ask your server for the most popular. Wine and cocktails are great too.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...\\n\\nYour main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil. Their Southern fried chicken is also great along with my favorite (and very filling) New York steak salad.  This bad boy has field greens, roasted peppers, avocado, green beans, crispy potatoes and red onion tossed in Gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and fried pickled egg.  Mmm Mmmm...\\n\\nIf you have enough room and you're not afraid to loosen that belt a notch or two, check out their desserts, I enjoyed their macadamia nut cheesecake. A friend had a Kona coffee ice cream sundae and another went \\\"lite bite\\\" and ordered their Mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream.\\n\\nBottom line, come hungry with many friends to enjoy the evening."}

While I'm no expert in pricing antique or consigned furniture, the items looked reasonable for the condition and quality. I saw everything for a $5 (adorable) dish to a $1,600 sofa in a matter of minutes. I was especially diggin' some of the really lovely and large antique mirrors - priced between $100-$150. \\n\\nBe aware that this place is *packed* with goodies and the quarters can be quite tight. Thus, if you really are seeking a treasure, make sure you devote some serious time to your search. Since I've only been in here once, I'm not sure how often the merchandise changes out, but based on the goods I imagine there are new items consigned on a fairly regular basis!

{"label":0,"text":"Avoid this dentist at all costs and go elsewhere. This man is a greedy con artist. I went to see him after a year or two of avoiding the dentist, and in need of a general checkup and teeth cleaning. I went to him due to a Groupon that seemed to have a good deal. Unfortunately, when I got there, he did the usual, x-rays, exam and everything, but then sternly and authoritatively told me I have not just gingivitis, but periodontal disease. For those that don't know, this is a very serious disease that involves bacteria so far underneath the teeth that they are literally eating away at the bone. Pretty serious stuff that just happened to require a $1000 extra deep cleaning that he was willing to do for me. \\nTotally freaked out, I went to MATC here in Madison and got a teeth cleaning for $30 where they also took x-rays and had two dentists on duty. Without me even asking them, both dentists said I have excellent teeth and that it's quite obvious I've been taking good care of them. Even the students who cleaned my teeth commented on this initially. I then asked them about the periodontal disease, and if gingivitis is even a possibility. Both of them said no, not in the slightest, but took another look at my x-rays just to be sure, ultimately making the same assessment. Once again, they told me my teeth were in excellent condition.\\nNow my father happens to be a dentist as well, but he's been retired for some time. Nonetheless, I sent both sets of x-rays to him, from Dr. Lee and MATC, and asked him his opinion. He concurred with the MATC dentists that I most certainly do not have periodontal disease or even gingivitis, and he strongly advised me to no longer go to Dr. Lee. Obviously, I never will, but I want other people to understand what a scam artist this guy is. Do not go to him, unless you want to be lied to and have your money taken from you.\\nOh, and I wanted to add this little part as well. After they told me very sternly that I have periodontal disease, I lightheartedly said \\\"Well, looks like it's time to turn the ship around then, and do what I can do reverse course.\\\" I expected at least the tiniest bit of encouragement from them, but none was forthcoming. In fact, the vibe I got was a very strong attitude of paternalistic judgment. Very odd and offputting. I now see it was part of the act. Whatever you do, don't go there.

Finally got our cups and went to town loading them up with different yogurt flavors and toppings.  Paid the scowl-faced girl, still not friendly, and headed home (literally 2 minutes away) to enjoy our yogurt.  Enjoy is not really how I would describe it after all.  A little fake tasting (we had chocolate, vanilla, cake batter, coconut, and cookies and cream between us), sorta weird and gritty texture and just not the best we have had.

{"label":1,"text":"FAIL!\\n\\nI've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThe restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.\\n\\nFood:\\nWe had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.\\n\\nAs with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.\\n\\nThe meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.\\n\\nThe seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.\\n\\nService:\\nWe were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?\\n\\nHere is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to \\\"tap out\\\" due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!\\n\\nPrice:\\nWe were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.\\n\\nLunch price is fair.\\n\\nSuch high expectations and such a let down..."}

It looks more like a dorm area than a business.\\n\\nThe tables and chairs are mismatched, which I'm sure is the style they're going for.  It would be cute if it just had something a little more to connect everything together, instead of a bunch of furniture thrown in.  It looks like left-overs from the dorms and frats that surround the area.  And it was sort of dirty.  Like dusty.  And the windows weren't clean.  And flies.

{"label":0,"text":"The service at this place is by far the worst service we've every received in this service industry town.\\n\\nHere's what we love: The food is great. The portions are very fair for what you pay. And that's why we've eaten there 4 times...... but.... here comes the bad....\\n\\nHere's what we hate: The location stinks for parking (remember to bring your walking shoes!). The stupid black\/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers (flip it if you need anything - Here's my first 'why are we tipping you?'). If you like more than one drink, forget about ever getting that refill. It ain't comin. Actually, when you order a diet coke, expect that not to come either (\\\"oops, I forgot\\\" - Seriously breakfast ain't that hard, honey). You might as well forget your food too. Your dining partner may get theirs, but you'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement; I suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction. The hostess' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants. The other 2, other servers brought our food. (Why are we tipping you, our server, when everyone else does your work?).  The cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me!' Crowded is an understatement.\\n\\nThe last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal, never said a word to us (with the exception of 'what can I get for you?' to take our order), but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day' (woman, I don't know you. And after ignoring us, this isn't going to save your tip).\\n\\nWe'd love to talk to a manager..... but one never seems to hold any presence on the floor. (Is there even one?)"}

Sliced salmon was good too, but I didn't really feel like waiting for the toaster to toast.\\n\\nService was okay with a waiter who refilled Diet Coke often but coffee not as much. I think he was maybe disappointed that we didn't go all in for the refillable mimosas or bloody marys.

{"label":0,"text":"The M Resort doesn't nearly deserve any of the praise and hype in my opinion.  Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and cr\\u00e8me brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  \\nHowever, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  \\nI thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.   \\nI will never step foot in the M resort ever again and neither will my friends or family.

Second, expect to do some serious digging in order to find the deals.

The shoppers had more excess energy I would expect out of a kid who just ate an entire box of Fruit Loops. I enjoy my personal space and really had none of that as they scurried around and got in my way as I mazed through the store.\\n\\nThe line to check out was looped throughout the entire floor layout. It's tough to put a wait to it since I gave up and left, but I would guess at least an hour. I would hope there would be some kind of payoff at the end other than a cart full of clothes. Maybe a good carnival ride?\\n\\nI'll fully admit that this rating is a little biased. I had been warned of some of these things, but had been told that the deals can be found through some hard work and borderline PI work. I unfortunately am of the wrong gender and therefore only had a small section, at most a tenth of the store targeted to my buying habits. I had trouble finding any clothes that suited my tastes and then when I walked to the shoe section, I was shocked. Every pair seemed as though they had been worn for a year. Have you been to the shoe section in a thrift store? Something like that. No offense to anyone interested in buying a second-hand pair of shoes; it just seemed strange to be in a retail store with items that were so heavily used.\\n\\nI left disappointed and a little frusterated.

{"label":0,"text":"If you are in the mood for rude service, from a manager nonetheless, then this is the place for you. \\n\\nWe had a party of 12 come here for dinner. We ordered food (not that great), appetizers and plenty of drinks. On their menu, it clearly says that drinks with double alcohol are $8, which we thought was quite the deal. So two friends of mine had two drinks, with double alcohol each. Totalling 4. Still with me? Good. So when the bill came, you'd think the two drinks per person would be $16 each. No. They neglect to tell you that it's $8 per alcohol shot, not the entire drink. So those two drinks ended up costing a hefty $32 per person! \\n\\nWhen this was brought up to the waitress, she brought over the manager who was a rude little french troll. He was sarcastic, loud and didn't know what it meant to please the customer. After explaining why we were charged that much, he just wouldn't listen to our explanation of how deceiving their menu is when it comes to that drink special. It just didn't get into his thick skull. At one point, sarcastically he said \\\"what do you want me to do, call the owner at home and have him come explain this to you?\\\". Fellow yelper Lourdes W. gave him a piece of her mind saying how rude he was being and that he had no tact. He needed to address his customer's concerns in a respectful manner and appease us since we spent quite alot of money with a party of 12. \\n\\nThis shut him up and we decided to just pay the bill and leave. For sure my friend will be calling their credit card to contest the charge. \\n\\nSay what you want about America and it's customer service skills, but something like this would have never happened in the states.

Dr. Allred worked closely with me to monitor her weight and come up with solutions that I was comfortable with. She didn't discount my input and never treated me as a first time over-protective parent. She always listened to me and made me feel respected. She's fantastic. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving DS 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Marion, one of the PAs. I'm not a fan of him. I did have to see him a couple of times for urgent appointments and I was not happy either time. I don't care for his bed-side manner. At one of the visits my daughter had a very itchy, unusual rash on the bottom of both her feet. She was only 19 months,crying and attempting to scratch her feet constantly. Marion wasn't able to tell what the rash was and just left it at that. No attempt to refer us to a specialist, no medicine given, NOTHING. I ended up making another appointment to see Dr. Allred, who was much more concerned about the rash and referred us to a pediatric dermatologist. It actually took several months of visiting specialists to get the rash to go away (however, they did give us medicine immediately to help her itching). Had I not trusted my gut and made another appointment my daughter would have continued suffering for even longer.\\n\\nI did see several other PAs in the office and other doctors as well and I like everyone else. The staff was always welcoming and friendly. The remembered me and my children and were sad to see us leave. \\n\\nOne note, if you are a little late to your appointment they can usually keep your appointment but if you are very late they will need to work you back into the schedule and sometimes that can take hours. Some people might be upset by that, personally I appreciated it. I understand that things come up and sometimes you might be late (especially with little babies) but they shouldn't be expected to push everyone else's appointments back to squeeze you back in. This happened to me once and they were kind about it and were able to work me back in 2 hours later. \\n\\nEvery time my kids got sick and needed an appointment urgently, they were able to get me in on the same day.

For the cash you're spending, there are better places if you're on a Vegas safari for an artistic and innovative meal.  Bartolotta publicly admits he's not a creative chef.   His plating is slightly better than Olive Garden.  But close your eyes...this is not the garlicky, red-sauced, heavily-cheesed Italian food Americans are used to.  The dishes we tried were fresh, light, and uncomplicated.  Ingredients were kept to a minimum, serving to enhance instead of obscure.  Simple Italian seafood, cooked to delicious perfection.  Mouth, welcome to Sardinia."}

{"label":3,"text":"This place has the Bomb green beans.  This actually has turned into a spot for hubby and I to go to when we want to cruise the downtown scene.  \\n\\nI highly recommend you get here before everyone gets off work, because like any other downtown metor area, parking will be limited.  \\n\\nAmbiance is what you should expect, dark\/dim lighting, loud music, and crowded.  Not too big of a deal because you will be so busy concentrating on demolishing your food any way.  \\n\\nWe have only been here 2 times and we have yet to try so many options here.  There are so many different pizza combos to try, that you better bet we are coming back to eventually try it all.   \\n\\nThe combinations of flavors that they put on their pizza is awesome.  Don't be afraid to add more protein...it might add that added Yum to your pizza.  Whats important to me when I eat a pizza, its the crispiness of the crust.  Thats exactly what you get, a nice crispy pizza. \\n\\nThis place is a must try!"}

I saw the Dr. for a total of 5 minutes before another woman (esthetician, perhaps?) led me to another room where she told me my current skin regimen wasn't working for me (which was surprising to me, I thought my skin regimen was fine, I wasn't breaking out or anything... my visit was for something totally unrelated) and tried to sell me some really expensive face wash and other skin products.  One of the questions on the paperwork  you fill out in the beginning asks you if you want to see the esthetician after the visit with the Dr. and I clearly checked the \\\"no\\\" box.  \\n\\nOverall, I waited about 5 minutes before seeing the doctor, which was a good thing.

We were extremely excited to go to one of your restaurants for the first time but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.\\n\\nWe went for lunch and I had the barbecued ribs for an app. They tasted like something you'd find at a school's cafeteria lunch. They looked like they had been sitting under a warming light for a few hours to add insult to industry.\\n\\nNext up were the \\\"smoked shrimp tacos.\\\" I wasn't aware smoked means charred\/burnt. They lacked any remnant of palatable flavor. The two tortillas were quite generous of you.   \\n\\nThe service was just as horrendous. The waiter pretty much never came by and I cleared off the table myself to make way for the food.\\n\\nLastly, another reviewer had it right about the location inside the casino. You're sitting right by the sports betting so you can hear people screaming and cheering every now again. The biggest issue for me was the cigarette smoke. It wafts in from the casino floor and make the eating experience that much more gross.\\n\\nSuggestion: go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant instead. Maybe Iron Chef's just shouldn't have restaurants and stick to the Food Channel."}
{"label":2,"text":"I went to Caffe Boa last night for a friend's birthday. I'd never been, but this is apparently one of her favorite places. I checked it out some of the reviews here to figure out what kind of place to expect and I got a little worried once I saw how varied the experiences were. Unfortunately it seemed like the best thing about this place was their happy hour, and we were going to miss that (uh-oh). So, I shook it off and decided that I would just have to see for myself.\\n\\nFirst things first: I just can't say enough about how great the staff at Caffe Boa was that night! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Our waiter, Wally, was fantastic! His initial soliloquy about the concept of the restaurant and review of the specials was borderline overwhelming, but he was happy to answer our questions, so it all worked out. Granted, the food and drinks took quite a while to get out to us, but we were busy chatting and generally having a good time, so we didn't mind. Wally was great about checking in on us: friendly and entertaining when we needed him and totally unobtrusive when we were otherwise occupied with each other. I also love that even though our meal had ended long before we decided to leave, we weren't rushed out. What a great, relaxing place to catch up with some friends! \\n\\nFor our meal, we opted for the pitcher of red sangria, and were not disappointed. They didn't mind a special request to make it sans-Sambuca (black licorice in my wine? - yuk!), and overall it turned out pretty strong, with a fruity kick. We also got the grilled rustic bread appetizer (aka bruschetta). The tomatoes were beautiful! Perfectly ripe and drizzled with olive oil - so sweet and delicious, but tragically piled high atop some very burnt toast. (Sigh.) Luckily we had some more sangria to drown our sorrows. By the time the main course arrived the blackened bruschetta was but a distant memory. It was a pasta-extravaganza for all - farfalle, tortelloni, and ravioli were stuffed or mixed with organic goodness and smothered in their various sauces.  Jen raved about her rosemary chicken ravioli, but my tortelloni stuffed with sirloin and prosciuitto left a bit to be desired. Picture little chunks of hamburger wrapped in pasta. It wasn't terrible, just not worth 18 bucks. Its just too bad none of us could afford any of the other dishes on the menu, they really looked delicious. \\n\\nAll in all a good time and worth a trip back for happy hour."}

{"label":1,"text":"While they do an acceptable job at manicures and pedicures, the customer service is not up to par.  My experience here is that they are overbooked and understaffed.  It would make a big difference if they keep to the time they tell you to be there for an appointment, rather than saying they can take you \\\"now\\\" and then have you wait.  That seems like a simple customer service fix.  I'll try a few different salons before returning here again."}
{"label":4,"text":"I tried The Deli for lunch a few weeks ago after seeing a lot of reviews on Urbanspoon for them. I can tell you that after just one visit these guys have won me over as a customer.\\n\\nFirst of all, they do everything right. Family-run operation, local produce, fresh ingredients and organic whenever possible. The service here is spot on... the serving staff are energetic and work hard to keep their customers happy from the point that you walk in the door until you leave.\\n\\nTo start with, my wife and I had the hummus with house made crackers, which are actually pieces of flatbread that are the perfect fit for this appetizer. It was fresh, tasted great and by far surpassed any other restaurant that we've had this at.  \\n\\nOne interesting thing that I noticed when I ordered a Coke: they plopped a tall glass bottle in front of me. This instantly got my attention and I was spinning the bottle almost immediately to scan the back . Yep, Coke with real sugar and no corn syrup (from Mexico). You can't beat it.\\n\\nBeing a sub sandwich fan, I was leaning towards \\\"The Deli Sub\\\", but something drew me instead to try \\\"The Deli Club\\\". I know at this point in the review I sound like I've been hypnotized by the owners, but this is one of the best sandwiches that I have eaten in years. Turkey, ham, cheddar, avocado, tomatoes, red onion and mixed greens on white bread. This is not something that I would normally order, but the flavors were amazing and getting me to try anything else on their menu after eating this is going to be a tough sell.\\n\\nMy wife went ahead with the sub, which also tasted very good - but for me is not even close to the club in flavor. As far as the sides go, give both of these a try:\\n\\n1 - Pasta with tomatoes, fresh vegetables, house made Mozzarella & basil pesto. Very fresh and tasted amazing!\\n\\n2 - The Yukon Gold potato salad with peppered bacon &\\n rosemary mixed with their homemade mayo. Incredible! \\n\\nI felt that for the quality of food that you receive here, the prices are reasonable. I've paid more at other places and received food that was far from the quality and freshness that you can enjoy here.\\n\\nThey have 1\/2 off all beer, wine and Sangria between 4-5pm, which isn't a very large window - but the prices are nice. Outside of The Deli, there is a small patio with seating available, and right next door is their sister business, Poppy's Place (a bar). I will give this place a try the next time I'm in the area on my way home.\\n\\nIn all honestly, naming this place \\\"The Deli\\\" is a bit deceiving. I walked in expecting an actual deli, but the experience that I walked out with far surpasses what I would expect from a typical deli."}

The burned ends poutine had pulled pork.\\n\\nIt all sounds impressive, and having read they won some gold medal at some bbq competition... honestly, the ribs were dry, the meat was tough and not fall of the bones at all. That's the most disappointing thing really. then the pulled pork which was moist and good but then some pieces were clearly sliced, which doesn't give it the same texture as pulled...\\n\\nthe roast chicken was the only thing I liked, it was moist and tasted good. The coleslaw was nothing special, fries were very good. The baked beans, well it seems they put some sort of herbs in it which I did not like, and they were a bit too tangy for me... \\n\\nThere are two bottles of bbq sauce on the table, a sweet one and a spicy one. I guess you're supposed to add it to the meat and eat, so you only put as much as you need... I'm not fond of this set up, I like my bbq drenched in the sauce as it cooks so the sauce permeates the meat, just my thoughts... and yes even with dry rub you brush some sauce on there to finish it off before serving!!! yeah all the meat had no bbq sauce on them!!!  whatchou talkin bout  Willis?\\n\\nThe poutine was ok, not enough sauce and pulled pork didn't add anything, was I supposed to add the bbq sauce on the poutine?\\n\\nI was hoping for something good, but even for dry rub, ribs should not be so dry and tough to eat... did I get a bad batch?"}

Well, maybe it's the fact that they overcharge for the amount of food they give you.  Quality is good, but the portions are too small for what you pay.

I usually prefer thick crust (I'm a big fan of bread), but this thin crust was great and I would definitely come back for more. We also ordered the dessert trio with the cannoli, tiramisu and New York cheesecake. The cannoli was delicious. I've never had tiramisu before, so nothing to compare it to, but it was good. The cheesecake wasn't what I expected; it was a lot lighter and fluffier than what I've normally had. It also came with a raspberry sauce, I believe, which I didn't care for. But I didn't come here for the cheesecake. Overall, the experience was great, the pizza was delicious, and i would absolutely return."}
{"label":0,"text":"On a recent trip to Icehouse we noticed our server sitting at a nearby table throughout most of our meal. Another server frequently came by our table to refill our water or to apologize for slow service. At one point I happened to look down and noticed bright green gum stuck to the back of both my legs and all over my knee high boots. Someone had stuck their chewed gum to the front of the seat. Upon letting the other server know so we could possibly get a towel or napkin I noticed our server still sitting at the other table. Finally she came by and when we once again mentioned the gum assuming someone would offer a towel or an apology she replied \\\"We all have personal problems.\\\" Um, what?!? \\n\\nIt wasn't her or the restaurant's fault obviously and I wasn't looking for a free meal or even an offer to cover the cleaning costs, but an apology or visit by the manager would have gone a long way. Just stop by the table with a wet towel, apology and offer to help and it would have been fixed. The gum came off and aside from some inconvenience and embarrassment at walking around with the backs of my legs covered in gum there is no lasting effect -- aside from the determination NEVER to go back to Icehouse. \\n\\nThat server was obnoxious and the management lacking."}

Second they hand you about 5 different menus. You also have hand written specials with drawings on pieces of paper everywhere on the walls of the restaurant even the bathroom. After looking through all of their menus we had a few questions about items we weren't sure about so we asked the server.  The server had no idea what they were either and had to go back to the kitchen to ask them.\\n\\nEven though the server didn't quite know the menu she was very nice and sweet. Food was pretty good nothing horrible but nothing spectacular either. The frozen beer was nice even though they ran out of kirin.

{"label":1,"text":"Very nice---but noisy--place. Why is it so noisy at the Wynn and Encore? Fellow Yelper Jim T. and I went to this place because we like a good steak and will try it anywhere. We decided to split the 40 ounce Porterhouse. Not only do you get more meat, but it is cheaper than getting two steaks of any size separately. \\n\\nI started with a wedge that I asked to be chopped. They chopped it, but it was way overdone with Bleu Cheese. The bacon was not very flavorful and overdoing the Bleu Cheese only made this dish average. \\n\\nNow to the steak: We ordered it medium. It came Medium-rare on the strip side, but well done (no pink) on the fillet side. What saved the day here, is Jim T didn't mind the medium rare and the flavor was very good. It was crusted just so, with a hint of salt and pepper. \\n\\nI asked for the SW sauce and the server brought out a trio of sauces: The SW sauce, (which is sort of an A-1\/barbeque blend thingy), Worcestershire, and a hot pepper sauce. I skipped the hot pepper stuff. \\n\\nSide dishes were grilled asparagus and au gratin potatoes. The sides were very nice and complimented the meal. \\n\\nAfter dinner we felt like a drink. I noticed they had vanilla ice cream for desert and asked if they could do a Brandy Alexander for me. \\\"Sorry, Sir, we can not do that since there is not a blender at the bar.\\\" \\n\\\"No blender anywhere?\\\" I said. \\n\\\"Sorry, sir. It would take forever to get drinks out of the bar if we were blending drinks.\\\" He said. Really. He said this! Interesting that Applebees and Chili's can figure out how to run an efficient bar, but The Wynn can't? Really? \\n\\nAnyway we settled for a glass of Port that was very good. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place. And will if I have a better experience next time. The steak was very good--if not how we ordered it. So, I will give it a provisional two stars now--may change it later. \\n\\nOverall I enjoyed Switch more (see my yelp on that) because the steak was better. \\n\\nAnd Steve, get the bar a blender."}

I don't always expect to see my breakfast before eating it. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nI have a full tummy, but dealt with too much noise and neglect to be satisfied with the meal or the experience."}
{"label":1,"text":"I don't have too much to say about Tropicana. The place was clean and the parking was convenient. And that's about it. \\nThe pool staff was as unhelpful and cocky as can be. The prices in the restaurants and ships in Tropicana are beyond a joke. Should you run out of sun tan lotion at the pool be prepared to pay $17+ for a replacement at the Tropicana. \\nAsked for a smoke free room.  Apparently they thought I said smoke full because that's what I got. \\nEven if they fix all that crap you still have to deal with the fact that you are at the end of the strip and have to walk a mile to get to he center of the strip. Pay a little more and stay somewhere closer to the center so you don't have to go so far to get everywhere you want to go."}
{"label":4,"text":"This was formerly known as Roberto's.  This is my favorite taco spot!  This specific location only!  I always get the same thing here and that is the Carne Asada Fries with everything but beans.  They usually make the fries crunchy but not burnt, but today some of them were soggy.  I am a big fan of their food here."}
{"label":0,"text":"Blek! Not only did the server take 15+ minutes to take our order, I had a crusty fork, and the salt shaker on our table had a dried noodle attached to it. I've had way better Asian food, and worked in Irvine, CA for ten years, so my standards are high, admittedly. My Ma Po Tofu tasted like it came out of a can. My friend's veggie Pho had bland soup base, and canned mushrooms, that's a killer for me right there.\\n\\nIf you want really good Pho, go to Tram's or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville. For suburb sushi, try Chaya in Sq. Hill. And for good Korean, go to Sushi Kim's in the Strip.  In fact, I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh, would be better than going here. \\n\\nOr just save a few bucks, and get a package of Ramen at the grocery store and add an egg to it. Even that's better than the so called noodles at Lu Lu's!"}

They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out."}
{"label":4,"text":"Some friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend, and decided to walk around near our hostel to find a place to eat. Less then a ten minute walk away we found Ye Olde Orchard Pub, and it was exactly what we wanted. It was different than most places we would have gone to in America, the food was great and the waiters were so nice. We mentioned it was my friends 19th birthday expecting a piece of cake, and we got a special drink complete with rules and a name I shouldn't mention. The waiter overheard us talking about where to go that night and came right up to us and suggested about five different bars and clubs we should go to, some of which ended up being the best parts of the night. We couldn't resist going back there the next morning and the breakfast was just as good as the dinner. I would recommend it for anyone but especially if you're a group of traveling students like we were its a great place to go. If we ever go to Montreal again it will be first on our list."}
{"label":2,"text":"They have a ton of really cute outfits for the club as well as  casual clothing, but unfortunately the quality is not the greatest. I've bought items in the past and when I got home I would find holes and the zipper was broken. They're return policy is really frustrating they give you a week and it can never be worn all tags must be attached and no return in club wear? Makes no sense, When most of the items sold are club attire. The staff does not have good customer service. I waited 17 minutes for them to acknowledge me when I wanted to try on a pair of shoes, when they realized they forgot about me they didn't even apologize."}
{"label":3,"text":"Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?"}

We played craps as first timers and they walked us through it and we really awesome about being patient with us. The downside is that the hotel is away from the strip and you need to take a tram to get to and from. The tram takes a while to get back an forth so you end up waiting around. Also it is a little older but it is very clean."}
{"label":4,"text":"Came here on Nelson's UYE, and I am extremely glad I came. I've driven by this stand many times. Tonight was the opportunity to finally try this place. After following Nelson's advice, I tried the tacos al pastor, or as many as you know it as the \\\"gyro taco\\\". While this place offers many different types of tacos, the star here is the tacos al pastor. I can safely tell you that this is probably the best taco I have ever had in my life. The meat itself is truly remarkable. The flavors are so complex and bold, yet very well balanced. And the side sauces are unforgivingly spicy and authentic. Mix that in with the pickled vegetables, and you will have yourself an amazing meal for 2 dollars. This is a great deal. Cash Only!! I cannot wait to come back and get some more al pastor here! Thank you Nelson!!!"}

However,  we had one in our party who was a lil picky about her prime rib, and the manager was courteous and prompt about offering a new cut, and fresh sides! Great customer service on the manager's part! Just be forewarned,  if you're looking for a quiet dinner spot around 8pm on a Friday night, best keep yer boots in the dust and keep steppin!"}

{"label":2,"text":"I came here with my team of staff for a staff meeting because we prefer going and supporting local business than chains like Starbucks. And if we are meeting, why not take the opportunity to treat our staff at good quality local coffee shop too, just makes perfect sense to us.\\n\\nWhen the 4 of us arrived, the general indoor seating area had a few large tables (large enough for 4 people) that were taken by single persons. So we resorted to having our meeting in the \\\"vault\\\" which has an open table large enough for us. This was our first time here and did not know whether the \\\"vault\\\" area was a quiet area or not, but we tried to discuss work without being overly loud. An hour later, a fellow patron leaving the room told us that it was the \\\"quiet room\\\" and that we should not be in there. \\n\\nNot seeing a single \\\"quiet\\\" sign around, I decided to confirm with Xtreme Bean staff and their response was that they don't know why people have the impression that it is a quiet room. It is just another room, nothing special about it.\\n\\nSo I want to make sure my fellow patron knows, if you want to have a super quiet space to work at, maybe staying at home is a better option, or go to the library. Please don't tell fellow customers to leave, especially those who could not gain access to the large tables, because those were taken by other solo customers who love to spread out their belongings on a table large enough for a group of four.\\n\\nWe all love to support local businesses, so please make sure you know what the \\\"rules\\\" actually are before confronting other customers about your need for \\\"quietness.\\\" If that is so important to you, please stay home.\\n\\nSorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review. But I just want other customers to know about my overall experience here was a good one. \\n\\nThe staff was helpful and the drinks were decent, but us customers could do better to help support the business by being a little more considerate and not take up more space than we need to. \\n\\nIf you take up a table large enough for four and others had no choice but leave because of that, you are indirectly taking the business away from the coffee shop. With more people there, they will sell more drinks and food. Of course, unless you plan to purchase enough food and drinks to cover the difference between one customer and four customers. I am just talking from a business owner's point of view, since I run a small business too.\\n\\nNote to staff of Xtreme Beans, please let me know if I am wrong about the \\\"quiet room\\\" since I last talked with you. I will be happy to take my staff somewhere else if the large tables were taken by single users and we could not use the customer designated \\\"quiet room.\\\" \\n\\nWe are definitely going to give Xtreme Bean Coffee another try though."}

{"label":3,"text":"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. \\n\\nThe price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.\\n\\nThe service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."}
{"label":1,"text":"Years and years ago this place used to be great, then it changed concepts. We had gone 9 months ago and hated it. We went again yesterday and it was meh. \\n\\nFirst, we had almost finished our food before the drinks were served. We ordered a house wine and a draft beer, nothing complicated. Seriously, 25 minutes to pour a beer at 2pm in the afternoon?\\n\\nNext, pub soft pretzels were sent back as dry and stale. Gross. Chips and salsa were basic. \\n\\nThe highlight was the sliders with fries. Thick, beefy sliders, not like the typical 'where's the beef' slider. Fries were battered and seasoned well. Very good."}
{"label":1,"text":"There are two types of people who are patrons of this establishment: the elderly and people with free passes.  We had free passes.\\n\\nMy fiance's work gave him two sets of Regal movie tickets.  That would be great back in Seattle where the company is because Regal's are all over.  Here, however, there are only two theaters in the Regal family and this is one of them.  The other is on Northsight somewhere.\\n\\nWe saw a 645 movie and it was all old folks.  Even with them, the place was deserted!  There is one guy working concessions (with his first AND last name on his name tag - I thought that was a little weird...), one chick in the ticket booth, and that's about it.\\n\\nThe actual theater was even worse.  The screen wasn't all that large, the sound was awful, and it was an \\\"old school\\\" theater.  I consider a \\\"new school\\\" theater to be one with stadium seating.  This theater you actually walked uphill when walking towards the screen.  Sounds backwards to me!  It actually might have been worse than a regular \\\"old school\\\" theater.  If we hadn't had free passes, we would have left.  Instead, we stayed and toughed it out.  \\n\\nI guess we'll venture to the Northsight location for the other two tickets.  I thought most of Scottsdale was upscale with a lot of folks around, not scarce and geriatric like Sun City.  I am no longer wondering why no one has reviewed this place - it needs to be put out to pasture!"}
{"label":4,"text":"I can't say enough about how AMAZING this place is.  My children are 9 and 6.  My 9 year old is not very talented in sports, especially team sports, but I wanted him to be active.  He was also having a difficult time in school socially and I wanted to find something to build up his self-confidence.  Master Joe has a fabulous demeanor and the kids respond beautifully to him.  He know EVERY SINGLE CHILD in his classes, no matter how many attend, and he calls each one of them by their name.   He and his team of Black Belt helpers work with the kids to develop proper techniques and form.  The kids advance according to their skill level, but no child is left behind.  Master Joe even took time to go to my son's school classroom to expose the children to Tae Kwon Do.  It was an excellent experience for my son as he used him to demonstrate techniques to the class.  I could tell my boy felt amazing after that session.  This is a family run business, and Kate, Joe's wife and partner works with each family to determine which classes and events will spark your child's interest.   This is an incredibly positiive place that I feel blessed to have found.  Master Joe continually teaches respect, focus and control...what child doesn't need to learn some of that???"}

{"label":0,"text":"This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have \\\"the biggest and best sandwiches\\\", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place."}
{"label":3,"text":"The food the Sports Deli does best on are the finger foods and sandwiches.  The buffalo wings we just ordered were spot on.  As good as any wings I've had.  My preference is to get the wings dry with the sauce on the side, that way the wings will stay crispy longer.  We also got the #8 Silver State (beef, pastrami, brisket, swiss) which was pretty good.  It kind of reminded me of NYC deli's...yeah, that good!  Next time though I'm going to grab a bite of the #7 Boulder City (pastrami, fried egg, bacon, cheddar)...a recipe to clog my arteries even more.  You're going down #7!...inside my stomach, that is, next time I'm near the Sports Deli.\\n\\nThe pizzas and burgers are just OK.  Not worth an attempt in my opinion, but then it again it's not my appetite or stomach.  To each his own!  But I'll stick to the sandwiches and finger foods."}

Be sure to check the specials listed on the chalk board near the entrance.  I like the decor, and facility, dining plates, utensils and glasses are clean.\\n\\nStaff is efficient and accommodating.

{"label":2,"text":"Intrigued by the many positive reviews, I decided to come here  to have a few drinks with friends for my birthday. It's a small bar and if you're driving down Main St. you just might miss it. They have a small parking lot that can fit about 10 cars so best bet is to park out on the street. During the night, you don't even have to pay to park. \\n\\nWalking in, instantly my eyes go to the decor. Very modern and cool. They have a Buddha rabbit, Buddha chandler, & they have little tables setup with comfy couches.  The environment is very relaxed and chill unlike most hipster bars downtown. \\n\\nThe specialty drinks were not what I expected them to be. For instance, when I ordered Graveyard Of Champions.. The cucumber ice was Majority of the small glass. The actual drink was minimal. The presentation was cool but I basically paid $10 for a large round cucumber ice. \\n\\nAlso when me and my friends would order the same drink, they would taste completely different. This happened with more than 1 drink. One would taste amazing while the other would taste nothing like it. the bartenders paid close attention to you though. And there would be someone who walked around picking up our empty glasses. \\n\\nI'd probably return again, in hopes to write a better review next time!"}

{"label":4,"text":"I've seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows, and I think after O, this is my second favorite.  Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.\\n\\nA lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.\\n\\nOn the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.  But whether you're familiar with the Beatles' or not, you're sure to leave entertained."}

Our visit this time definitely wasnt as good as our previous visits. I kinda had the feeling that maybe our service was different because we were using our groupon deals this time. \\nBetween the three of us, we got three massages, one body scrub, and two pedicures. We were told it would be okay if we were ready just a few minutes before our appt time. I do have to admit that we should have been ready early. We got sidetracked and ended up being about two minutes late. After getting walked to my massage room upstairs and trying different cushions and towels out for my comfort level, my therapist began my massage about 10 mins after my appt time. The massage felt like it ended rather quickly. As soon as i was done, i looked at the clock and noticed that my therapist stopped at exactly 50 mins after my appt time. Really? My 50 min massage turned into a 40 min massage because we were trying to find the right cushions to use? Okay, i tried to let it go because technically I should have showed up earlier. Next was my body scrub. Ive had body scrubs a couple other times at other places. This one felt so rushed and the salts were scrubbed on my skin rather quickly and roughly. \\nMy friend's experience was similar to mine. She waited in the lounge area to be called for her service. Her person didnt come to get her for the longest time. Then while she was getting her pedicure, her massage therapist came looking for her because she wasnt done w her pedicure yet and tells her that she is cutting into her massage time by 20 mins. Seriously? Its her fault that she was waiting in the lounge forever without being called? They ended up talking to a manager and making it right. She did say she enjoyed her pedicure tho!\\nMy third friend wanted a deep tissue massage and when I booked the appt, I was told it would cost an extra $15 with our groupon. When we were checking out, we were told it was $30 extra.

The waiter had won me over with replacing her spoon several times. \\n\\nWe asked our waiter about specials and what he would recommend. He didn't offer us a name, and be prepared. Their shirts only say \\\"staff\\\" on them. They do not have name tags. So, if you ever need your waiter, get a good look at him or her. \\n\\nWhen trying to fulfill our questions with answers, there was a lot of hesitation. A lot of \\\"ummm\\\"... \\\"well...\\\". Hey, guy, I don't eat Chinese. I don't think I have ever been to an \\\"authentic\\\" Chinese place.......it was kind of like the blind leading the blind.\\n\\nWe ordered the hunan beef with mein, and the General chicken meal that comes with rice. \\n\\nIt seemed like in no time at all, less than 5 minutes, the cho mein was placed in front of us. This confused the hell out of me, because I thought it was suppose to come out with my meal...?\\n\\nNone the less, we start to taste the PLATE of noodles.\\nI have to admit, they were tasty. I'm not an expert, but they seemed to be cooked appropriately. Not mush, and not rock hard.\\n\\nOur proteins come later, but not at the same time. My guy's chicken came first, and then a few minutes later, my beef arrived.\\n\\nThe taste is good for the first few bites, and then it all is just repetitive. Almost like an overly syrup-ed food that just coats your tongue and you don't taste anything else but sweet....until you bite down on a chili or a jalapeno. It didn't really seem balanced to me.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention that we are still waiting for the rice that goes with the chicken...? We had to ask for it about 10 minutes after our food came. \\n\\nI was always taught, that if you need more of the beverage you ordered, you put it on the edge of the table...as a hint for a refill. Well, between 2 different servers, we got passed 4 times. It was after they had dropped off the check that they refilled my water.\\n\\nBefore tip, it was around $23...with leftovers.\\n\\nI mean, it was fair. I don't see myself craving it in the near future...."}
{"label":4,"text":"I may be biased when I write this review because my experience at this casino was in a penthouse suite.... my daughter enjoyed the private lounge with unlimited sodas and snacks but it did not at all take away appetite for the most amazing room service breakfast on the Las Vegas strip! Their crepes are absolutely delicious! The staff was very cautious to who entered the suite access allowing us to feel safe and secure 24\/7 since the hotel is considerably large. I would not stay there any other way but in their penthouse suites. It is a perfect location for those who do not want to be in the middle of the strip party. It is a great hotel for the seasoned Vegas traveler."}

{"label":1,"text":"Aria is a beautifully modern resort, and the cafe decor reflect that (although the color scheme was a little cold utilizing lots of grays).\\n\\nThe Good\\nOur service was great, contrary to many of the reviews.  \\n\\nThe Bad\\nYes, this is Vegas and I expect high prices. However, I also would like the quality to be somewhat reflected in the price.  Steak and eggs ($25) had a cut of meat that was full of tendons and fat.  Half of it was not edible.  The food coloring also made me lose my appetite (to their defense I believe 90%+ of restaurants have meat with good coloring).  I think I'm becoming a vegetarian.\\n\\nThe Chilaquiles was drenched in Salsa Verde (which tasted like it came from a can).  It's like eating a salad drenched in dressing.  The flavors didn't come through and all I could taste was the salsa verde.  Most if it was not eaten.\\n\\nRed velvet pancake was okay.  Topping was overly sweet.  Great if you are Buddy the Elf.  Being ably to customize would have been good.  This sugar overload is \\\"before\\\" adding the syrup, which did come on the side.\\n\\nThe fresh juice was highly recommended by the waitress.  I ordered it without questioning.  Afterwards I found out that we were charged $7 for lemonade and more for watermelon juice. The fresh squeezed element is good.  But...for that price I would rather get a fresh pressed green power juice at the Canyon Ranch Spa.  Lemon+water+sugar just doesn't seem to warrant that.  \\n\\nTotal bill $80+ tip for 2 adults.  We left hungry...."}

Today we were having a late lunch so we decided to check it out. \\nThere were four of us and we all ordered something different. It was like a big sampler. My husband ordered the Chicken Nachos and the Chili. A lot of times nachos are so huge that it big enough for 3 people. The nachos here are just the right size. Tithe chips were topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, smoked chicken and jalape\\u00f1os. They were tasty. The smoky chicken made them amazing. The chili came in a small crock. It was bubbling and hot. It was full of flavor. It had beans and bites of smoked brisket. \\nMy oldest son ordered the Redneck Club sandwich. It came on a brioche bun that had brisket and pork with a bit of coleslaw. He inhaled it. That's very telling if how good it was. \\nMy youngest son ordered a burger. He's a purist so it was just meat and a bun. You know it's a good burger when it tastes good without any toppings. The burger tasted like it was hot off a charcoal grill. It even had grill marks. \\nI ordered 6 wings. I was going to share them but after tasting them I no longer wanted to share. The wings are not winglets and they aren't fried. They are whole wings and they are grilled. They are the best wings I've ever had. I was kind enough to share . . . This time. \\nFor dessert we ordered peach cobbler. It was a little different from normal cobblers. It was more like a thick piece off a dense cake. It had a lot of peaches on it along with vanilla ice cream. It was warm and satisfying. It was big enough for 3 of us to share. \\nWe'll definitely be back. I recommend you stop in and try it out.  Make sure to order wings."}

They gave a good chunk of lobster meat.. so delicious. Just don't order it to go because i liked it so much i ordered it to go and they didn't give the lobster meat at all.. so disappointed.\\n- chicken alfredo linguine.. good, the white chicken meat is good but it is not grilled like what i expected, i think it was sliced roasted chicken but the overall is good because it is not greasy not too much butter and i didn't feel bloated after that.\\n\\nTheir bread was good, served warm and so yummy, one of the best bread but you have to ask because they won't give out the bread unless you ask for it.\\n\\nThe only thing that was off: the food took a while to get out, we had to wait for each of the food to get out and the restaurant was not even crowded."}

Throughout the course of the meeting I consistantly asked why my finacial wouldn't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools (that cost the same per credit hour) I would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing. Everytime I asked it no one would answer me... They just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee... I went home, got online and did my own research, the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours... FOR THE SAME DEGREE!!!! If i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree I would attend an Ivy league school... F$%^ THAT SCHOOL... The best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that I wasn't going to sign or pay anything until I did my own research, she started getting super aggressive to the point if she wasn't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently...

{"label":0,"text":"I was looking around for some place to have lunch before going to the Shark reef Aquarium and I just happened to pass this place. They had their menu on the outside and I saw they had a lobster roll. That is all I needed. So I went to the hostess and got seated. I was told a server would be by shortly. Um not what happened. Now the place was virtually empty and I noticed my server had looked over and saw me sitting there waiting but he never came up and offered me a drink or anything. He just kept staring at me and carried on conversations with his co workers. It made me very uncomfortable. Then he finally comes up and asks me if I am ready. He offers no apology for the wait or the fact that he saw me sitting there and did nothing. He did not ask me if I wanted a drink or anything like servers normally ask first he just asked me if I was ready and had a huge attitude when he asked. The annoying tone in his voice was like I had kept him waiting while I stared at the menu forever or something like that. His attitude surprised me considering I knew what I wanted from the second I walked in and I was the one who was kept waiting but ok. I also wanted to get to the Shark Reef aquarium before I started collecting my social security so if anyone should've been annoyed it should have been me. I ordered my food and guess what more waiting. Again he was too busy doing his own thing to go check on my food. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. I know it was not the kitchen for one thing the lobster is served cold so is not like they have to cook the lobster and heat it up or anything and my side was coleslaw. How long does that take? I had already thought it was a mistake coming there because my server acted like a complete asshole but it was even worse after I tried this pitiful excuse for a lobster roll. It was disgusting. After I picked through my food I waited and waited for the server to bring me my check. I had to flag him down at some point because if not I would have sat there forever. Well wanting my check must have been a problem because Mr. Attitude acted even more stuck up when I flagged him down and asked for my check. Needless to say after $23 for that lunch I felt leaving unsatisfied and downright stupid for wasting my time and money there. The food was shitty and the customer service was even shittier. others many have a better experience but personally for me I will not ever waste my time and energy here again. Mandalay Bay and Vegas itself has WAY too many superior options for dining for me to waste me time where I am clearly not wanted."}

Much like the end scene of Planet of the Apes, man's masterpieces cannot be fully erased.\\n\\nFull disclosure: Gameworks was never amazing, nor was it a consummate achievement of mankind, but my god in heaven, has it fallen far from being an enjoyable diversion.\\n\\nVisiting Gameworks the other night after a movie, I did not even recognize the inside. In the past year, Gameworks has transitioned from a two-story video game mecca to a trashy, shotgun-style Dave and Buster's knock-off with a few old racing and carnage games sprinkled along the wings. What was once full of racing simulation games, a multi-story pirate-cum-balloon fight (or for the old folks, it used to be a shooting tower), and new-age arcade games, has become a vacuous shell with half-corroded consoles and token-munching, brainless ticket dispensers. \\n\\nMuch of the interior has been gutted, leaving odd walking patterns and vast arrays of blank canvas. 10-15% of the arcade games were \\\"under repair\\\" and another 5-10% were in great need of service (Virtua Tennis now has the cinematography of a Lumiere Bros. film). The remaining games feature nothing you could not find in the lobby of a movie theatre. Instead, Gameworks' focus is on ticket-oriented games such as Deal or No Deal and some game where you jump in the air and get tickets depending on when you land in relation to an arbitrary, electronic lighting wheel.\\n\\nIf that level of lowest common denominator banality thrills you, change this rating to 5 stars.\\n\\nIf I'm scraping the bottle of the barrel for positivity, I can compliment their beer selection (San Tan and 4 Peaks) and pricing (5 bones a pint); however, that does not justify the large-scale Peter Piper Pizza whitewashing of Gameworks' product line.\\n\\nI'm giving it a courtesy star for the fond memories, but, like Lady Liberty on the beachhead, Gameworks is completely broken."}

They seemed to only be interested in each other and huddling up to talk to each other on the other side of the bar where nobody was sitting.\\n\\nPeople, such as myself, would come up to order a drink and they never checked on customers or anything. I stood there for close to 10 minutes before this guy who had been at the bar with his girlfriend for a while drinking and playing games, whistled to get the younger guy's attention to come serve me.\\n\\nHe finally comes over there and walked over to them and said, \\\"What do you need?\\\" They said, \\\"Dude we don't need anything, but you have a customer that has been standing here for the longest time waiting to be served.\\\" So he looked over at me and hesitantly walked up. He still didn't say anything. He didn't greet me or say, \\\"Can I get you something?\\\" NOTHING! He just stood there with this blank look on his face like he couldn't IMAGINE what I might want from him??!!\\n\\nSo I said, \\\"Um, I would like to order drinks\\\". And he said, \\\"Oh...drinks?\\\" AS IF this was news to him that someone would come up to a damn bar to order DRINKS??!!  So I ordered my drinks for myself and the person I was with. So he made the drinks and never ONCE made eye contact or exerted any sort of true customer service. He just rang me up.\\n\\nThe damn pina colada was $9.75 and it was below mediocre. argh  I went ahead and tipped him because if I didn't, I know his lame ass would have probably blamed it on me being black and NOT on the fact that he's a lousy bartender that gave shitty, dismissive service!\\n\\nOn top of that, while I was standing there waiting for my drinks to be made, the older guy argued with this couple about the amount they charged them for their drinks. They were arguing that because they were playing video poker (or whatever game it was up there) that they shouldn't be charged full price for their drinks. They were saying that they were staying at the hotel and the night before they paid less than $9 for the same drinks BECAUSE they were playing video poker. But on that day, this older guy was charging them $12 for their drinks.\\n\\nThe older guy was very gruff in his tone when telling them there was NO WAY they could have paid anything below $9.75 for their drinks. So he was basically calling them liars. When they tried to appeal to the younger guy, he was confused as hell. In one breath he was telling them they charge less if you're playing games at the bar...and in the next breath he was telling them they had to pay full price for their drinks? They were pissed.\\n\\nAnyway, the bartender that I had to deal with was named Ben. Steer clear of his clueless, non customer service having ass! I don't know what their deal was that day but they pissed me off. All I wanted was a pina colada and instead I was treated like I was a nuisance to them! So weird!"}
{"label":3,"text":"Doughnuts. Donuts. Dog Nuts...whatever you call them for the most part, they're all tasty. Well maybe not dog nuts. \\n\\nLets get real, this place is like a fried dough time machine and I love it. Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the \\\"Wonder Years\\\" TV show. \\n\\nI originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \\n\\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \\n\\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called \\\"The Texas\\\" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called \\\"The Alaskan\\\", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?. I'm not sure, but sadly it didn't matter, \\\"The Texas\\\" was sold out and \\\"the Alaskan\\\" is made-to-order. Next time, my doughnut loving friends!"}

{"label":3,"text":"The staff does a great job of staying pleasant while being swamped and dealing with families. The food is very tasty - the BBQ bacon burger really hit the spot. The burgers are roughly a half pound, the applewood-smoked bacon is cooked just right, and the BBQ sauce is sweet. The fries and onion strings are not really seasoned but there is a sauce bar with a wide range of selections to make them tastier. There is currently a special shake: the kitchen sink. Highly recommend it as it tastes like every candy bar you want to have in your pantry was put in the blender. If it's just you and one other person, consider sharing a large side as it's enough to enjoy but too much to fill up on and miss out on the shakes, floats, sundaes! Seating can be tricky on colder days as there are a few tables and booths inside and they are placed close together for maximum possible occupancy. There is a sizable outdoor patio for outdoor seating. We will definitely be returning to this place for burgers, fries, and shakes."}

What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \\\"Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\\\"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!

The dog itself was decent but the bun coulda woulda shoulda be smaller or toasted or something. The girls were kinda lackluster but maybe it was because we went on a Sunday.

{"label":1,"text":"The Wife and I decided to give Which Wich a try since we were driving past and really like subs. We'll keep driving next time.\\n\\nOverview (copied from their website): \\\"Guests use red Sharpies\\u00ae to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. They select a sandwich from one of 10 categories, then choose the type of bread, size, cheese, spreads, and vegetables. The sandwiches are prepared to guests' exact specifications and delivered in personalized sandwich bags. After they've enjoyed their wiches, guests are encouraged to draw on their bags with the same red Sharpies and hang their 'artwork' on the community wall.\\\"\\n\\nAt first, this seemed like a cool concept, but we were quickly frustrated by the fact that, having just spent time deciding what we wanted to eat and marking that info on the bags, we then had to stand at the counter while an employee inputted each of our orders -- item by item -- into the system. It would have been much faster for us to just place our order at the counter in the first place, rather than repeating the process twice.\\n\\nWe waited nearly five minutes for our sandwiches, even though there was no line in the place. While I understand that time and care must be put into making sandwiches, I've been spoiled by places like Jimmy Johns and Potbelly where sandwiches are made quickly and taste great.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the taste of the sandwiches. Meh. I've experienced better. The bread was, at best, forgettable (the Wife hated it). The meat (pastrami) was overly salty, and the sauces lackluster.\\n\\nOverall, to the question of \\\"Which Wich?\\\" I reply, \\\"Pretty much anyone else's!\\\""}

The Half-and-Half (Arnold Palmer) was terrific and refillable.  The Meatloaf was incredible as well, there are so many layers of flavor.  It takes all the things you like about meatloaf and amplified them, while removing the things you don't like.  The Meatloaf sits on two extra thick slices of buttered Texas toast.  The final addition is a thick layer of cheese on top of the meatloaf, forming a cheese skirt on the side.  I said cheese skirt, people.  This is reminiscent of the legendary Squeeze Inn in Sacramento or Napa Valley.\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese, though highly recommended by the waitress (who claimed to be a M&C aficionado), was alright.  The cheese sauce was grainy, but there's the pleasant surprise of scallions in the dish.

{"label":1,"text":"The parking is not that easy here, even if you arrived early.  I think that we ended up in someone's backyard lot.  It's not that close to the freeways.  But, catching the W.Sox v. Cubs game here for Spring Training is awesome!  However, don't get me wrong, it's not even a tenth as good as catching the rivalry in Wrigley (which I've done too), but close."}
{"label":1,"text":"My first time here. Grabbed 2 bobba drinks. It was ok but super expensive. It was over $11 for just 2 drinks. Yikes! Decor is kind of outdated and grungy hence doesn't explain the high prices."}
{"label":2,"text":"Probably the most basic of all the Station properties with the Oyster Bar being the best reason to come here. The steak restaurant is a pretty decent deal for lunch too. Cheap rooms, gambling, buffet, drinks etc. \\n\\nI dislike the fluorescent lighting in the poker room. It makes me feel like I am in a high school biology class. I do like the sports bettors parking spots which gives action junkies a close place to park to put in their bets.\\n\\nThis isn't a bad place if you're on a budget and have a vehicle but I would still opt for Fremont St if I were here on an el cheapo trip to LV."}
{"label":4,"text":"Some of THE BEST margaritas that we have ever had!\\n\\nThe food is outstanding, the atmosphere is great, the service is always fast, friendly, and accurate (they get your order right - just the way you like it), but the margaritas are absolutely fantastic!  We love margaritas and have had thousands of them all over the U.S. - and the world, for that matter - and these are the best ever.  I am sure it is the high quality of tequila they use but the bartenders really know how to make them.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"label":4,"text":"Jayd is amazing at what she does! I highly recommend her! I went in and asked for a dark tan, which is what I left with. The Customer Service is great. She makes you feel very comfortable from the time you go in until the minute you leave. I'm a spray tanning newbie so she told me everything I needed to know about how to get it to last. She was thorough and my tan looked fabulous, tan, and even. I'm a bit overdue for a spray tan now. I will definitely be booking another appointment with her soon.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"label":1,"text":"Not a huge fan of this place, although the barber did give me a proper fade. I would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait.... its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless"}
{"label":1,"text":"This place seems like they gave up on watering all their plants - and not adding any new ones - a year ago...reminiscent of the final days of a going-out-of-business sale. \\n\\nThe slim selection of mostly desert plants looked mostly half-dead, even the cacti. There was a small selection of citrus trees (priced in the $100's) that were skinny as a pencil and had dried, shrunken fruit (lemons or limes so black you couldn't tell exactly what they were) falling off. In the green houses were more less-than-stellar looking plants.\\n\\nThere was a good sample of Mexican pottery, recycled steel landscape ornaments, and painted steel wall ornaments. Much of it was enjoyable to look at, but the prices were much more than I wanted to pay. \\n\\nOnly reason I didn't give this one star is that the young attendant was courteous and friendly.\\n\\nI had bought a $100 LivingSocial Coupon for $40.50 (with promotion), but after checking out the selection, decided to head home and get my money back. I went to Home Depot the next day and got five healthy plants for under $40 - which probably wouldn't have bought one similar type plant at Desert Gardens.\\n\\nUnless you are on the hunt for some particular rare cactus to fill your collection, save your money and time and go to Home Depot or even Wal-Mart!"}
{"label":1,"text":"I remember when I heard this place was opening, I was stoked. At last, there was to be a non-chain fine dining restaurant on the West side. It only took a year and half for me to go there. I justify this lapse as giving them plenty of time to get the kinks out.\\n\\nIn order to beat the noise and crowds, we went for an early dinner on Friday. Our server was very amiable and polite, but I'm not entirely sure of his knowledge of the restaurant's products. \\n\\nUpon looking at the menus, I must agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the dishes offered were uninspired. There were several items that looked good, but none that I felt were \\\"must try\\\" or innovative. \\n\\nI was pleased to see several classic cocktails on the drinks menu. However, when I ordered one, it was made improperly. This seems to be the common theme with Skye -- they aim high, but miss the mark.\\n\\nWhen the appetizers arrived, I thought they were like Applebee's-type offerings, but made with fancier ingredients (e.g. the duck and brie quesadilla). The coconut shrimp tasted like something out of the freezer.\\n\\nThe shrimp in my entree were woefully overcooked, at the risotto did not taste of tequila or cayenne, as the menu promised. My companion's steak was rather good, but her mashed potatoes looked like plastic, and tasted odd, as if maybe they contained parsnips or turnips. It's no surprise that we did not stay for dessert.\\n\\nI am torn, because I thought the food was so blah. Yet selfishly, I want Skye to succeed, in the hopes that more restaurants will want to make a go on the West side."}
{"label":3,"text":"I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\\n\\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!"}
{"label":0,"text":"We really wanted to love this place because it's so close to our home.  We went for Happy Hour. This is a dive bar, which is fine, they have their place, but the set up is a bit confusing. You have to order food and drinks at the bar and they will bring the food to your table. \\n\\nWe ordered a large pitcher of mango margaritas and two quesadillas. The bar tender misunderstood and made regular margaritas. She said no problem, I can fix it, and dumped some mango pur\\u00e9e into the mix, rather than start over. The result was a congealed, gloppy mess. \\n\\nThe quesadillas were nothing special, perhaps a little overdone and dry. Hard to imagine a Mexican food place that can't get the basics down. \\n\\nAll in all, it seemed like a good place for cheap buds with regulars hunkered down at the bar. But I do t think we will be returning."}
{"label":0,"text":"I am surprised at all the good service reviews for VT.  I have given this place a few tries and have not once had good service.  Usually when I experience \\\"bad\\\" service, I look for ways for the bartender\/waiter to redeem themselves during the process.  Unfortunately, I have never had that here.  I checked the reviews here because this place is one of the few that I have dined at in Arizona that, for lack of a better phrase, left a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the food, I was never too impressed with that either, but the reviews say otherwise from my fellow Yelpers.  \\n\\nI will say that my last experience was so bad it prompted me to write the corporate office and they were responsive and sent me a $25 gift card.  Maybe I will give them a 3rd chance based on everyone's feedback."}
{"label":4,"text":"Hands down, the best grocery store in LV.  My girlfriend and I live nearby, and this is where we do most of our shopping for food and household items.  The customer service is phenomenal.  If you could dream up the perfect supermarket, this would be it.  Theres a bakery, hot food line, butcher, and salad bar, and the selection of wines and cheeses is good too.  The store is immaculately clean, and well stocked at all times.  They carry items you wouldn't find in most grocery stores, and you can even suggest that they stock something in particular if they don't already have it.  Love shopping here.  The cashiers and security guards are super friendly and know us by name.   Glaziers sets the standard in which I measure every other supermarket."}
{"label":2,"text":"So I found myself in Pittsburgh last weekend visiting an ex who was in town working at the Pittsburgh Auto Show. I recalled seeing a famous Pitt sandwich shop on Food TV and did a little research. I found that the original Primanti Bros. was down on 18th and decided to take a walk down from the Westin for lunch. I took the approx 15 min walk down Penn Ave and finally found the restaurant around a corner in what turned out to be the \\\"Strip district\\\". The Strip was crowded, grungy, ugly, and full of cheap ($3 & $5) Steelers shirts and \\\"Terrible Towels\\\". Something about terrible towels irritates me to no end (and Steelers fans in general, maybe because I had a roommate for a bit who was a total jackass and loved them...and I'm a Pats fan!). Street Vendors lined the sidewalks hawking mostly junk ($1 finger puppets!) as locals and tourists bustled around making Valentines day purchases. There were plenty of gritty locals selling flowers out of buckets and trash pals on the sidewalks in-between the cheap t-shirt tables. There were some cool shops and eateries bunched in, overall a scene I am not opposed to at all!\\n\\nSo I got to Primantis, opened the door to see a line right in front of me about 15 or so deep, I found the end and began to wait. A family coming in behind me were obviously Primanti virgins as well and asked me 20 questions about what to do now that they were there. After about 20 mins I was at the front and was shown a seat at the bar. I was delighted to see Yeunling Lager available as it brought me back a few years. It is brewed in PA and FL, I worked on a trail crew in FL for a bit and would buy plenty of it with my $40\/week stipend, actually beer was all I bought on that money The beer is not available in CT or MA to my knowledge. I started on my bottle of Yeunling and got an order in 15 mins or so later. I chose the regular sized 'fish and cheese'. I do not eat 'meat' otherwise I would have gone for the steak or pastrami that seem to be the favs. I soon discovered the couples on either side of me at the bar were also new to the place and had also seen it on Food TV and had made it a destination. Have you had one??? they asked with a tinge of excitement and curiosity in their voices! \\n\\nAbout 20-30 mins later we all found out what the fuss was about. Well the sandwich didn't look as magical as I would have been led to believe with all the out of towners ooohing and ahhing but it looked good and I was hungry. I squeezed down to prevent filling leakage and bit in....mmm. Now I'm not a cole slaw fan but it was obvious upon first bite the slaw made the sandwich. I can't lie, being that the only animal I eat is fishes and almost all of my friends and coworkers eat meat I am ordering a fish sandwich pretty often at places I don't necessarily choose but go to frequently. So french fries and fried fish has to be pretty special to surprise me, these did not surprise but throw them together with the slaw on the white Italian bread and you have a very tasty sandwich. The fries were slightly soggy, not salty, not hot, limp and bland would describe them well with a pleasant taste. The taste of the fish did not stand out much over the slaw, The slaw was exclusively cabbage to the best of my memory. It was tangy and acidic and packed a flavor punch compared to the bland fries, bread and fish. \\n\\nThe sandwich was messy and losing components on each bite, which fell onto the deli paper it was served on. Luckily the napkins were right in front of me and became a hot item with the neighbors as well. Normally I don't like a loose, avalanche prone sandwich but it did not bother me here as the 'sloppiness' was part of the charm. The waitresses carried piles of sandwiches around separated only by the deli paper. The room had a warm character and felt like people had been enjoying warm messy sandwiches and beer there for a long time. It was slightly dark and extremely crowded, but not a bad crowded as everyone was happy to be there eating a famous sandwich. When you are done you walk to the end of the bar, tell whoever happens to be standing there what you had (honor system!) and pay under $10 for a sandwich and a beer! \\n\\nOn my way out I ordered a sandwich to go as I was meeting my ex on her short lunch break. I grabbed her the 'Rajun Cajun Chicken\\\"  which she enjoyed but commented on the soggy nature, which I am sure was compounded by being wrapped 45mins previous to being eaten. When I walked out the door there was line wrapped all the way to the side of the building approx. 50 people deep. I believe it was snowing at this point and in the 30's, so I was impressed by the will of the people to obtain sandwich royalty. In the end I thought it was a fun experience and a tasty sandwich. If I am back in Pitt I will certainly consider going back for a bite. If I am eating meat again at that point I would anticipate being more delighted by the Primanti Bros. Check it out, embrace it."}
